			<TEXT>FUTURIS will sell down its stake in cattle subsidiary Australian Agricultural Company through a float or spin-off to shareholders. At Futuris&apos;s annual meeting in Adelaide yesterday, chief executive Alan Newman, a former deputy of the late Robert Holmes a Court, named son Peter Holmes a Court as AACo&apos;s new chief executive.
Mr Holmes a Court would steer AACo to a re-listing, with Futuris retaining a substantial stake of between 20 to 40 per cent, Mr Newman said.
He said overseas and local companies might be interested in buying AACo outright but &quot;it&apos;s highly likely that the outcome will be a re-listing&quot;.
&quot;That is one option; there are a number of different ways it can go to market and we will be evaluating all of those,&quot; Mr Newman said.
AACo, Australia&apos;s second oldest company, has been reported to be worth $300 million.
It has about 370,000 head of beef cattle valued at $98 million and 6.5 million hectares of property in Queensland and the NT.
Mr Holmes a Court said AACo would maintain close ties with Futuris&apos;s rural arm, Elders.
&quot;Across the agricultural industry as a whole, rationalisation is continuing and I believe there are opportunities in our specific sector of the industry, beef, to build a large company,&quot; Mr Holmes a Court said.
Mr Holmes a Court recently sold his 16 per cent stake in his mother&apos;s cattle company Heytesbury for $30 million but said AACo was not in competition with Heytesbury.
Meanwhile, Futuris chairman Bill Beischer announced he would stand down as chairman within two years, leaving Mr Newman to take the helm.
Futuris would then appoint a managing director &quot;preferably and probably from within the organisation&quot;, Mr Newman said.
&quot;My lot is not up with Futuris but I have to take on a different role,&quot; Mr Newman said.
Looking to first quarter operations, Futuris was trading &quot;substantially ahead of last year&quot; - pointing to strong profit growth this year.
&quot;Given that our second half is usually stronger than our first half, we are therefore quietly confident we can sustain our growth in earnings,&quot; he said.
Futuris closed up 1c to $1.65.

Chief executive officer Peter Holmes a Court said the result wasachieved on a 42 per cent increase in cattle revenue to $31 million forthe quarter from $21.8 million.

			<TEXT>THE recently-floated Australian Agricultural Company expects a 10 percent rise in cattle prices to boost its 2001-2002 profit result.
If the present demand continued, the company would exceed its forecastprofit of $21.1 million for the year, chief executive Peter Holmes aCourt said yesterday.
But the latest forecast failed to revive AACo&apos;s share price, which fell2c to 82c yesterday.
The shares, issued to retail investors at $1 and to institutions at$1.10, have contracted since listing on August 10.
AACo just beat its prospectus forecasts for earnings before interestand tax with a result of $29.5 million for the year to June 30.
Excluding the impact of cattle herd revaluations, under theself-generating and regenerating assets (SGARA) accounting standards,EBIT rose 27 per cent to $32.8 million. The previous year&apos;s result washelped by a $26 million upward revaluation of the company&apos;s cattleherds.
The latest result included a $516,000 reduction in value under SGARA.
The profit was achieved on revenues of $81.9 million, compared toprospectus forecasts of $81.1 million.
Cattle sale numbers were 120,619, down about 13,000 on the previousyear, with the reduction attributed to the impact of an extended wetseason which restricted stock movements as well as delayed live exportshipments.
Mr Holmes a Court said the strong earnings and a cash flow of $17million for the year reflected the strengthening of the beef market.

			<TEXT>FUTURIS subsidiary Australian Agricultural Co is on track for a July listing, says chief executive Peter Holmes a Court.
Beef producer AACo has appointed a chief financial officer and lead managers for its book-build to institutions and retail investors. Futuris would also take up to 40 per cent stake, Mr Holmes a Court said.
Short-term marketing opportunities existed in Europe&apos;s usual beef markets because of the foot and mouth and BSE scares and also into the European Union but it was &quot;small potatoes&quot; for the long term.
&quot;The big picture is that people have got an education on the benefits of buying Australian beef,&quot; he said. &quot;Australia has that reputation, there&apos;s no e-coli, no foot and mouth and no BSE what that means is, long-term, Australian agriculture is in a position to benefit.&quot;
Full-year, pre-tax earnings would be about $25 million compared with $44.5 million after a revalution of its herd and new accounting standard.
Beef prices remain high thanks to a low Australian dollar but in a global sense, in US dollar terms, they are &quot;at a reasonable level&quot;.
AACo would reduce climatic risk through acquisitions but was likely to pay a premium for properties that added value to its existing 6.5 million hectares and 380,000 head of cattle in Queensland and Northern Territory.

			<TEXT>CATTLE group Australian Agricultural Company has bought a chain of Perth pieshops as its extends its &quot;paddock to plate&quot; strategy.
Executives looked at almost every pie operator in Australia and ate a lot ofpies during their quest to find the right acquisition, the company said.
AACo paid about $3 million in cash and equity for The Jesters Jaffle Pie Co.
It has 31 owner-operator franchised stores in Western Australia and alicensed New Zealand store.
As of yesterday, Jesters&apos; 100 per cent beef pies would be made with AACobeef.
The purchase comprises two business units - a centralised cooking facilityand a retail franchising system. Chief executive of 178-year-old beefproducer AACo, Peter Holmes a Court, said he expected the deal to reap $10million in sales this financial year.
Jesters receives royalty income as well as earnings from the supply ofcooked ingredients to the franchised stores.
AACo - 42 per cent owned by Adelaide-based Futuris - intends to roll out thefirst east coast Jesters store and pursue international licensingopportunities in 2003.
Jesters had &quot;grown very quickly in the last 3 1/2 years to become one of thefastest-growing&quot; franchisers in Australia, Mr Holmes a Court said.
AACo shares rose 2c to 94c yesterday.

The company - 40 per cent-owned by Adelaide-based Futuris - yesterday posteda 30 per cent rise in net profit to $20.6 million for the year to June 30.
Chief executive Peter Holmes a Court said AACo would not exceed the resultthis year, but he gave an upbeat outlook for 200304 built on an expectedrecovery in cattle prices and AACo&apos;s aggressive acquisition plans.
He said export demand from the primary markets of Japan, South Korea and theUS was improving.
In addition, the group&apos;s capacity to produce quality beef for the domesticmarket was strong with most of AACo&apos;s grazing properties outside droughtareas. Despite the short-term chal lenges, investors were hungry for meatyprofit stories, pushing the share price to a three-month high of 75c, up 5c.The 12 per cent lift in earnings before interest and tax to $32.8 millionwas built on a $12 million rise in sales revenue to $94 million and buoyantcattle prices in the first half.
&quot;In the year since our public listing we have delivered a strong result,initiated the first stages of the business strategy and positioned thecompany for growth,&quot; Mr Holmes a Court said.
Goals for 2002-03 were to pur sue to the &quot;paddock to plate&quot; strategy ofvalue-adding, brand development and herd expansion through acquisition.
The company also announced a $500,000 investment in Rural ManagementPartners, which manages 60,000 cattle.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIAN Agricultural Company expects its full-year net profit to be 33per cent higher than its prospectus forecast, after making a solid start tothe financial year.
The 178-year-old cattle producer, which listed in August last year,yesterday reported a net profit of $28.14 million for the half-year endingDecember 31, 2001, up from $11.91 million in the previous first half.
Last month, the company flagged its full-year result would be 15 per centabove its prospectus forecasts.
AACo chief executive officer Peter Holmes a Court said the company was verycomfortable heading into the second half of the financial year.
&quot;Softening prices caused by the outbreak of BSE (mad cow disease) in Japanhave caused us to conservatively assume a 7.5 per cent drop in cattle pricesin the third quarter, with no change assumed in fourth quarter,&quot; Mr Holmes aCourt said.
&quot;This means that very strong cash flows will be met by a marked marketreduction, meaning our full year result will be approximately where we standtoday.&quot;
Wilson HTM analyst Andrew King said things were going AACo&apos;s way for tworeasons.
&quot;It&apos;s the combination of a great season and higher-than-forecast livestockprices,&quot; Mr King said.
&quot;It&apos;s a good start in a net profit sense but the key in terms of cash flowis the last three months of the year, which is critical when they turn off65 per cent of their cattle.&quot;
AACo&apos;s result augured well for 40 per cent owner Futuris Corp, which reportsits half-year profit tomorrow.

			<TEXT>STRONG cattle prices have lifted the Australian Agricultural Company&apos;sannual profit forecasts, pushing up its shares almost 6 per cent yesterday.
The company, which listed on the Australian Stock Exchange in July, forecasta full-year profit of $21.1 million by June 30 this year.
But the prospectus outlined a 5 per cent fall or rise in cattle prices wouldhave a $12.8 million impact on pre-tax earnings.
Chief financial officer Luisa Catanzaro said profit would rise despite theBSE - or mad cow disease - outbreak in Japan late last year which draggedcattle prices back from record highs.
&quot;However, the market remains in advance of prices achieved at the start ofthe financial year,&quot; Ms Catanzaro said. &quot;The strong cattle price for thefull year to June, 2002, are likely to considerably exceed prospectus&apos;forecasts.&quot;
The Australian Agricultural Company (AACo) is almost 40 per cent owned byAdelaide-based rural and car components maker Futuris and has more than400,000 cattle throughout Queensland and the Northern Territory.
It doubled earnings before interest and tax to $17.1 million in the threemonths to September 30 after cattle revenue soared 42 per cent higher to $31million.
Chief executive Peter Holmes a Court said after the first quarter thecompany had taken advantage of a 20 per cent rise in cattle prices and soldaccordingly - 7.6 million kg of meat, up from 5.9 million kg in theSeptember quarter of 2000.
AACo will present its half-year profit on February 12. Its shares closed 5chigher to 93c yesterday.

			<TEXT>GOOD cattle prices prompted the Australian Agricultural Co yesterday toforecast its 2002-03 net profit would be only about 10 per cent below itsrecord of $20.6 million.
AACo initially had expected its profit would be 10-20 per cent below theprevious year, based on average rains and falling beef prices.
The 179-year-old rural enterprise - with almost 380,000 cattle on 20Queensland and Northern Territory stations - expects cattle turn-off pricesto continue rising in 2003-04.
It reported yesterday its earnings before interest and tax for the ninemonths to March 31 fell 8 per cent to $21.1 million. Revenue grew 15 percent to $73.3 million.
Chief executive Peter Holmes a Court said AACo had no intention of swayingfrom its model of not reducing its herd numbers as its stations were inmostly monsoonal areas and had not been severely affected by drought.
&quot;In the (March) quarter, we experienced widespread rain in the northern wetseason and cattle prices increased sharply before plateauing,&quot; he said.
AACo is Australia&apos;s second oldest company after being spun off in 2001 fromFuturis Corp, which retains a 37 per cent holding.

			<TEXT>CATTLE producer Australian Agricultural Company is predicting a jump incattle prices and demand this year, but still expects its earnings to fallbefore a pick-up in 2003-2004.
The company yesterday reported an 87 per cent drop in net profit to $3.78million for the six months to December 31, 2002, due to sharply lower cattleprices.
AACo chief executive Peter Holmes a Court said the first half ranked as oneof the toughest ever for Australia&apos;s cattle industry.
However, AACo was on track to meet its profit expectations and was lookingfor acquisitions.
&quot;It will be down 10 to 20 per cent on the previous year&apos;s result which was arecord $20.6 million,&quot; Mr Holmes a Court said. &quot;We look forward to 2004where we see a return to double-digit growth in earnings per share.&quot;
He said despite the drought, AACo&apos;s cattle remained of high quality withmany of its properties benefiting from rain in January and this month.
Executive director of operations Don Mackay said cattle prices had risen inrecent months.
During the first half, the value of AACo&apos;s cattle rose to $496 a head from$466 at June 30, 2002.
Shareholders can expect to receive an interim dividend this year, with anannouncement likely in May along with AACo&apos;s third-quarter results. AACo&apos;sshares fell 1c to 88c yesterday.

			<TEXT>AFTER a dry and difficult nine months, Australian Agricultural Company expects profit growth this financial year be at the lower end of its previous forecast.  
AACo in February said it remained on track to deliver full-year profit growth of about 15 to 25 per cent but yesterday said it would be closer to 15 per cent.  
The comments came after it reported operating earnings of $13 million for the nine months to March 31, $8.1 million lower than the previous nine-month period.

			<TEXT>THE Menegazzo family of Victoria became Australia&apos;s largest landholder yesterday after taking full control of the massive Stanbroke Pastoral Company.  
Family members, who farmed potatoes before moving into beef, made up half the Nebo syndicate which bought the company from AMP Life for $490 million in September.  
Yesterday the family, originally from Swan Hill, Victoria, purchased the remaining 50 per cent from Nebo partners, Peter Hughes and Hungry Jack&apos;s founder, Jack Cowin.  
Stanbroke chairman Peter Menegazzo refused to disclose the price, saying only it was &quot;a lot of money&quot; and the company value was at least $700 million.  
&quot;The partners were terribly pleased with the amount of money they received,&quot; he said.  
Stanbroke is one of the world&apos;s biggest beef producers with about 435,000 head of cattle, just shy of competitor Australian Agricultural Company&apos;s 460,000.  
The company is also one of the world&apos;s largest landholders with more than 25 properties covering 10 million hectares, ahead of AACo&apos;s seven million.  
&quot;We will start very shortly looking at the strategic properties,&quot; Mr Menegazzo said.

			<TEXT>THE Adelaide-based S. Kidman and Co has bought three vast Northern Territory stations with 50,000 head of cattle and regained its mantle as the nation&apos;s largest landholder.  
It follows a decision by the former No. 1 landholder, the Stanbroke Pastoral Company, to sell the three stations on the Barkly Tableland.  
It makes the Australian Agricultural Company, part-owned by Adelaide-based Futuris Corporation, the nation&apos;s largest cattle company with 460,000 head.  
Kidman general manager Greg Campbell said it was buying the properties on a walk-in walk-out basis with more than 50,000 branded cattle.  
It follows a split between the owners of Stanbroke, and a decision by majority owner Peter Menegazzo to buy out his partners.  
Mr Campbell said the purchase completed a key component in the company&apos;s growth strategy.  
&quot;For some years we have been seeking a large northern Australian breeding property to guarantee a supply of quality assured steers for our Queensland Channel Country stations,&quot; he said.  
The three stations, Helen Springs, Banka Banka and Brunchilly, covering 11,400sq km, were also ideally located to provide a geographic link between its Queensland and East Kimberley properties.

			<TEXT>* Rural FUTURIS is riding high on the sheep&apos;s back with investors clearly rushing into the rural services and automotive group as its key assets revel in rising commodity prices.
Cattle and wool prices are booming for its Elders business, car manufacturers say they are now in recovery mode and the planned float of the company&apos;s beef arm, Australian Agricultural Co, is well on track for a July listing.
Futuris derives about 70 per cent of its income from agricultural businesses through its wholly owned Elders subsidiary with 30 per cent coming from its Automotive Services arm.
&quot;If anything, the bank (Futuris&apos;s Elders Rural Bank, a joint venture with Bendigo Bank) is having a hard time at the moment because farmers are repaying their loans,&quot; says Futuris executive director Les Wozniczka.
The market re-rating is taking place amid a kind of renaissance in Australia&apos;s rural sector. Analysts have placed the equivalent of five buy recommendations, three holds and one reduce on Futuris stock.
Shares in the company have risen more than 17 per cent since early January, enjoying a strong rally in late March, and are now trading around $2.25.
&quot;Both of these areas (rural and automotive) are now coming back into favour,&quot; said Paul Jensz, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst.
&quot;Commodity prices have done well ... and car manufacturers say the bottom has been reached,&quot; Mr Jensz said.
The company itself believes that there is a realisation that Australia is in a unique and very fortunate position amid scares about the world&apos;s food supply.
Mad cow disease, foot-and-mouth, the mercury scare in European seafood and worries over genetically modified food have severely damaged the image of many of the world&apos;s leading food producing countries.
Retailers in Europe are now demanding that Europe radically change regulations so food can be sourced according to quality.
&quot;There&apos;s been a realignment on where countries should source their food imports from,&quot; another analyst said.
European livestock numbers have been drastically reduced and the United States is facing a potentially bigger problem with genetically modified foods.
&quot;The US has GMOs in cotton, maise, grain but they haven&apos;t been diligent in which areas have GMO plants and which areas don&apos;t,&quot; Mr Wozniczka says.
Because of this, the US was under extreme pressure when supplying cereals to Europe, he said.
&quot;This may be one time where being a island gives us an advantage,&quot; Mr Wozniczka said. &quot;In the US, they are seeing Australia as a food country for the world.&quot;
And, while the realignment is expected to take some years, producers in Australia are already enjoying improved livestock prices and expect the market to sustain its strength over the next few years.
Cattle prices have risen about 20 per cent in the past year to about $700 a head. Sheep prices have more than doubled to about $120 a head.
But beyond the positive outlook for Australia&apos;s agricultural industry, Mr Jensz said Futuris was becoming better understood as a company which provided services to the rural sector.
The industry was also expected to be spurred on by rationalisation which has left just three big players - Dalgety/IAMA, Elders and the independent CRT, controlling about $5 billion of agricultural inputs.

			<TEXT>If the proposed takeover of Australian pesticide company, Nufarm, comes to fruition, it will represent the first time a private equity firm has joined forces with a Chinese company to seal an overseas acquisition. The bid also comes in the wake of agribusiness, Futuris Corp, requesting that investment banker, Citigroup, and corporate advisory firm, Caliburn Partnership, sell its 43 percent holding in Australian Agriculture Co, for which JPMorgan and Mallesons Stephen Jaques are the advisers. Transactions of this nature only serve to reinforce Australia&apos;s reputation as a breadbasket, but hope exists that the Nufarm deal will change this perception.

			<TEXT>The announcement on Tuesday that leading Australian diversified industrial,  Futuris Corp, intends on selling the 42 percent stake it holds in the Australian Agriculture Company will test the theory that the country&apos;s rural land is being undervalued in light of the steadily increasing global demand for clean and safe food.  Citigroup and Caliburn Partners, the investment bankers appointed to oversee the sale, are likely to find no shortage of interested buyers either here or overseas, with, for example,  Macquarie Bank&apos;s interest in acquiring rural land already well known. After steady rises saw its share price close up last week at $3.12, analysts say AACo stock is likely to make even further gains. ABN Amro currently has a takeover target of close to $3.77 per share, which puts the value of the nation&apos;s oldest agricultural company at almost $1 billion.

			<TEXT>After years of crippling drought, Australia&apos;s agricultural and food processing sectors are facing growing demand from the industrialising economies of China and India, as well as increasing demand from Europe for biofuels. Futuris moved to capitalise on the heightened interest in the sector last Tuesday with the sale of its 43 per cent holding in Australian Agricultural Company (ACCo), effectively placing the asset on the auction block. ABN Amro Morgans analyst Belinda Moore said a full takeover bid for the company would attract a price of around $3.77 per share and was likely to come from Macquarie Bank&apos;s Pastoral Fund. Rural property investment vehicle PrimeAg, run by former National Farmers Federation head Peter Corrish and ex-Woolworths boss Roger Corbett, is likely to benefit from the interest in ACCo, particularly in light of its upcoming float.   
 Although Incitec Pivot&apos;s talks with Nufarm over a possible merger appear to have stalled, merger speculation has continued and the company is said to be in the crosshairs of Israeli0based crop protection group Makhteshim Agan. Austock analyst Paul Jansz said a failure to invest in the agribusiness supply chain had resulted in the sector&apos;s inability to cope with a sudden increase in demand. MR Jansz said &apos;so the scramble now had been to work out how we get the supply-side response happening, groups like Futuris and some high net-worth individuals are all working out what they want to do&apos;. Also on the lookout for potential suitors is Dairy Farmers, which has shed 600 staff members and reduced costs by as much as $40 million over the past three years. Fonterra has been discussed as a possible suitor for the company, as have Goodman Fielder and Nestle. Dairy Farmers main rival, National Foods, is also on the block, although a sale has been delayed by this year&apos;s sharp fall in earnings. CommSec said in a report on Thursday &apos;retailers are trying to cap prices in order to keep consumers buying&apos;.

			<TEXT>Australia&apos;s largest beef producer,  Australian Agricultural Co (AACo), may soon be foreign-owned after major shareholder,  Futuris Corp, announced its intention to sell its 43 percent stake. Futuris chief executive, Les Wozniczka, said the $300 million stake was a &#226;&#8364;&#732;wonderful asset,&apos; but was undervalued by equity markets. The company wishes to focus on its telecommunications and forestry operations, and has commissioned a global sale of its share in AACo by the end of the current financial year. Mr Wozniczka said  Citigroup and Caliburn would conduct the sale, while  JPMorgan would act as its financial adviser.

			<TEXT>Interest from potential Singaporean, Japanese and Brazilian buyers, as well as local financial buyers such as Macquarie Bank, is adding to controversy surrounding the &apos;iconic and extremely strategic asset in rural Australia, Australian Agricultural Co. Although Futuris has received criticism - on the grounds of its own weak share-price and drought-affected state of the Australian grazing industry - for its confirmation that its 43 percent stake in AACo is on the market, the $300-$350 million value of Futuris&apos;s AACo stake is not reflected in Futuris&apos;s market valuation, so it is perhaps preferable to have the stake in cash. Another source of angst has been that AACo appears not to have been given advance notice of the sale, so it is had little time to defend itself against the possibility that a buyer might break the company up and therefore endanger its growth profile.   
 Futuris, who has appointed Citigroup and Caliburn Partnership to represent the company throughout the sale process, is understandably attempting to look after its own shareholders, increasing speculation that a premium-priced takeover bid for all of the company is an option that should not be discounted. Meanwhile, Futuris is pitching its AACo stake as an opportunity to buy an asset with long-term strategic value with 630,000 head of cattle and 8 million hectares of grazing land in Australia&apos;s north, where rainfall is better than in the south.

			<TEXT>Credit Suisse, has given beef cattle company,  Australian Agricultural Co, a positive rating due to the company&apos;s exposure to increasing cattle and agricultural land values. The broker, however, considers the company to be an asset play, rather than an earnings play. Accordingly, the key driver of increases in the company&apos;s value in the future will be dependent on a global increase in meat consumption by more than 3 percent per year, coupled to the availability of grazing land falling or remaining static.

			<TEXT>The good purchase prices being attracted by outback stations indicate the mood in the Australian cattle industry. Last year,  Australian Agricultural Company (AACo) had paid $97 million to Heytesbury for two stations in the Northern Territory Barkley Tableland region. With 24 stations and more than half-a-million head of cattle, AACo is the nation&apos;s biggest corporate cattle company. Now comes news that two more NT cattle stations have been sold. The latest issue of Herron Todd White&apos;s (HTW) Month in Review reveals Tanumbirini Station has sold for $31 million, while Inerway Station sold last month for $17.65 million. According to Herron Todd White NT director Terry Roth, stations around Alice Springs have seen significant activity. John Burke, real estate manager at Elders Queensland, said breeding stations are seeing good demand.

			<TEXT>The  Australian Agricultural Co is hoping that abating drought conditions will help address a current oversupply of cattle and offset rises in the cost of feed grain. The nation&apos;s largest cattle company&apos;s weak half-year profit of $5.9 million, down 30 percent from the same period in 2006, saw its share price dip 23c yesterday to close at $2.99. ABN Amro Morgans analyst, Belinda Moore, said AACo&apos;s real value lay in real estate, calling its rural properties &apos;strategic assets&apos; that can only rise in value. Meat &amp; Livestock Australia, meanwhile, this week predicted cattle prices would remain at levels either equal to or less than last year&apos;s December fourth-quarter figures prior to a further fall in 2008.

			<TEXT>Corporate activity could be imminent for cattle group  Australian Agricultural Company, with its share price hitting $3.20 yesterday, up from around $2.70 in recent weeks. Mirvac boss Greg Paramor&apos;s appointment to the board has sparked suggestions that AACo may be considering securitising its properties. Shares in Futuris, which owns 43 percent of AACo, have also been on the rise, since its Elders division, in conjunction with Optus, gained $958 million from the federal government to build a broadband network. Futuris shares have risen over $2.60 this week for the first time since 2001. Paramor could also be planning something Mirvac, with rumours Mirvac is looking at acquiring development group Sunland, whose shares have risen sharply of late. That would be a big play, given Sunland is capitalised at over $1.2 billion after entering the Dubai apartment market with its new Palazzo Versace project.   
 A takeover would please Sunland&apos;s major shareholders, including CVC and James Packer&apos;s Consolidated Press Holdings. In other news,  Valad Property Group re-listed slightly weaker after finalising its $1.2 billion entitlement offer to fund the purchase of Scarborough, although it is still trading above the issue price. With the property sector hit by interest rate and sub-prime concerns in the US, investors could be finding safe havens in takeover targets  Investa Property Group and Multiplex, which are still attracting big volumes.

			<TEXT>Cattle prices have risen in recent months, despite rising international demand for beef. The  Australian Agricultural Company has reported reduced profits of 40 percent in the past year. The company faces increased competition both from South America, which produces double Australian exports, and the return of North American cattle to the market, according to  Goldman Sachs. AGC chairman Nick Burton Taylor says the company has good relationships with many retailers, including Woolworths, and with individual restaurants and hotels.

			<TEXT>The Dutch-based Rabobank, which was advising AMP on the sale of its Stanbroke cattle business to Australian Agricultural Company, ended up financing the winning bid by the Nebo consortium. Hungry Jacks founder and consortium member Jack Cowin is also one of Rabobank&apos;s biggest clients. Not a good look. 
The case&apos;s folding after a three year stoush means that a lot of juicy information about AMP and AACo&apos;s management workings may never come to light.

			<TEXT>AMP has agreed to pay Australian Agricultural Company $10 million to settle a dispute over the sale of Stanbroke Pastoral Co in 2003. About half of the money will be divided up as a 2c special dividend for shareholders of AACo. 
The legal dispute, over AMP&apos;s sale of Stanbroke to a lower bid by Nebo Group, had been in court for a week. In settling with the payout, AMP did not admit liability.

			<TEXT>AMP has strongly defended claims that it engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct during a tender process covering the sale of its Stanbroke Pastoral company in 2003. The Australian Agricultural Company is claiming up to $115 million in damaged in the Federal Court because of the alleged deceptive conduct. 
Lawyers for AMP told the court that it decided to go with a $417.5 million offer from the Nebo consortium rather than a $420 million AACo bid because it believed the lower offer contained fewer transaction risks. AACo later increased its bid to $460 million, even though AMP had already secured an agreement with Nebo. 
AMP also poured water on claims by AACo that it lost out in the acquisitions because AMP chief executive, Andrew Mohl, had told the cattle operator&apos;s advisers AACo was giving him &apos;the shits&apos;. The email in which Mr Mohl made the comment was nothing but a &apos;good humoured, jovial exchange&apos; between the AMP boss and Peter Hunt, the executive chairman of boutique advisory firm Caliburn, AMP said. 
Former AACo chief executive, Peter Holmes a Court, could appear as a witness as early as today.

			<TEXT>Peter Yate&apos;s Allco Equity Partners is looking at least one more listed company at the same time as the private equity company tries to finalise its involvement in the increasingly politically charged Qantas Airways takeover. Another company where there has been some interesting buying of last is Futuris Corporation, which is best known as the owner of rural merchandiser Elders, has definitely been under the microscope lately given the view that it is trading at a discount to the sum of its parts, with ABN Amro for instance last week valuing it at up to $2.66 versus $2.21 yesterday. A joint bid with Incitec Pivot or Macquarie Bank could be one strategy that AEP would take in funding a tilt, while assets such as Futuris&apos;s large stake in Australian Agricultural Company could be sold into the market or into Macquarie&apos;s new cattle fund. 
Also noted is that the 1 cent fall in Qantas Airways stock yesterday widened the arbitrage spread in relation to Airline Partners Australia&apos;s takeover offer to 4.4 per cent. There is also suggestions that the consortium might have to raise more equity and less debt, how this would affect returns is not so clear.

			<TEXT>Australian Agricultural Company (AACo) has seen its 2006 net profit plunge by almost A$7 million as the drought continues to weaken cattle prices. AACo&apos;s A$10 million net profit was down on 2005&apos;s A$16.8 million figure, but company forecasts for higher productivity and sales of its higher margin wagyu beef product have led to expectations of a lift in operational profit for 2007. Broker ABN Amro Morgans said the result held few surprises and that AACo should enjoy a strong year underpinned by a good seasonal outlook and rising land and cattle prices. &apos;[The current share price] would be rerated if Futuris sold out&apos; said Bridges senior analyst Gregg Taylor&apos;, however he noted they have been a reasonably passive major shareholder so far. The company also played down the threat of increased competition for prized cattle stations from a new Macquarie Bank agribusiness fund.

			<TEXT>AMP is again being taken to court by the Australian Agricultural Company to appeal an earlier decision allowing the sale of Stanbroke Pastoral Company to a rival bidder. 
Participation in a mediation process was recommended yesterday at a directions hearing, although if that fails the case will go to trial on February 19. 
AACo offered $540 million for Stanbroke but lost out to the Nebo consortium who offered $40 million less. They attempted to injunct the sale in 2003 but failed and Stanbroke was sold. 
Three-and-a-half years later AACo has put together a stronger case and filed a statement-of-claim alleging deceptive and misleading conduct under the Trade Practices Act as well as a breach of a tender process contract. 
ACCo is claiming up to $75 million in damages for the cost of its initial unsuccessful bid as well as loss of future potential earnings and claims to have made three bids, $491 million on September 1, $501 million four days later and $541 million on September 8, all of which were higher than the successful Nebo bid. 
AMP said that the lower bid was accepted in light of concern over the breaking-up of the iconic business as well as problems with the highly conditional nature of AACo&apos;s bid. 
Goldman Sachs JBWere is targeting a SGARA profit of $12.3 million and ABN Amro $8.7 million.

			<TEXT>Giant feedlot operator, Australian Meat Holdings (AMH), might be breaking up and selling off in the next couple of months. Swift &amp;Co, the parent company to AMH said it was reviewing &apos;strategic and financial alternatives&apos;, including a sale, a merger, strategic partnerships or refinancing. The announcement has sparked interest from local cattle companies including, Australian Agricultural Co, Cargill Australia, Teys Bros and Nippon Meat Packers. &apos;The assets of the company, not necessarily as whole but in part, would be interesting to a number of parties, said Nippon general manager of operations Stephen Kelly.

			<TEXT>Amid speculation that private equity firms are looking at the assets of conglomerate Futuris Corp, the companies share price could continue increase after heavy trading last week sent the stock soaring. Including Australian Agricultural Co and Forest Enterprises, Futuris has stakes in several agricultural companies and has also partnered with Optus to bid for funding to build telecommunications infrastructure in the bush.

			<TEXT>Corporate cowboy Futuris is itself considered a private equity target as ABN AMRO said the company would be worth far more broken up. The prized asset is Elders, the rural merchandising business. Also Futuris&apos; 43 per cent stake in cattle producer Australian Agricultural Company. 
Meanwhile Toll Holdings may dawdle on its ACCC undertakings following its takeover of stevedore Patrick in 2006. Toll has already avoided selling key assets such as Pacific National, instead moving to split the businesses into separate entities. Nevertheless the Patrick Bass Strait shipping interest could soon be sold to ANL, now owned by French shipping company CMA CGM.

			<TEXT>News that Consolidated Press Holdings could seriously considering selling its cattle properties to private equity or a financial buyer for $400 million to $500 million could be a sign that despite the current drought Australia&apos;s rural assets remain a keen proposition. For the Australian Agricultural Company, which owns around 2 per cent of Australia&apos;s land mass, this could also be a helpful development. It could be valued more highly for its properties than for its earnings.

			<TEXT>Although Futuris Corp has recently accepted less than book value in the sale of its holding in Tasmanian-based agribusiness group Webster and its stake in junior telecommunications provider Amcom, this will not be the case for cattle grazer Australian Agricultural Company says Futuris chief executive Malcolm Jackman. Mr Jackman expressed disappointment that Futuris had sold its stake in Webster for less than book value, a transaction believed to have been managed by JM Financial. He said because AACo has a high net tangible asset value, a better than book value sale price was expected.

			<TEXT>In a move to reduce debt and reinvest in operations Australian Agricultural Company is in negotiations to sell as many as four of its Queensland cattle stations. Chief executive Stephen Toms said major shareholder Futuris Corporation is now fully supportive of the property sale strategy. ABN Amro analyst Belinda Moore has a &apos;buy&apos; recommendation on AAC saying the fall in oil and grain prices has reduced the cost of production for the company. Properties for sale are believed to include Wondoola, Dalgonally, Kalmeta and Canobie. Macquarie Agricultural Funds Management, the newly merged $1 billion group, is speculated as being a likely interested party.

			<TEXT>Futuris Corp has sold its 18.4 percent stake in junior telecom Amcom for 50 percent of book value raising speculation that it may offload its 43 percent stake in Australian Agricultural Company (AAco) for less than its $126 million carrying value. Amcom operates fibre-optic and broadband services in WA and has a 20 percent stake in iiNet. Futuris is also seeking to offload its automotive business and the Webster agribusiness group. Austock analyst Paul Jensz says the market is more interested in the future of AAco than small ticket items like Amcom. BBY analyst John Welsh said Futuris has to unload at least one of these businesses to clear up its debt issue.

			<TEXT>Almost all small cap stocks in the agricultural sector are trading below asset value. Analysts say that apart from managed investment scheme operators, Australian Agricultural Company has the sharpest discount - its share price is less than half its asset value - followed by Marlborough Sugar factory. ABN Amro Morgans says discounts on both companies are unjustified. ING Investment Management portfolio manager Sinclair Curry says primary producers such as AACo and PrimeAg Australia are a lower risk given their property holdings. Southern Cross Equities says PrimeAg is also undervalued. ABN Amro Morgans is encouraging investors to buy all three stocks - PrimeAg, AACo and Marlborough Sugar.

			<TEXT>The chief executive of Futuris, Malcolm Jackman, yesterday said that he expects the sale of the company&#8217;s 43 percent stake in Australian Agricultural Company to be completed by next June and in any way possible. The position is in opposition to the stance of previous chief executive, Les Wozniczka, who wanted to dispose of the holding as a block, a move which would have automatically led to a takeover. An alternate way around this would be a transaction similar to the sale of the stake in Tower Australia to DaIchu by Guinness Peat Group. Parties interested in the sale of AACo consist of a UBS-advised consortium including Allan Myer&#8217;s Tipperary Group and James Packer&#8217;s Consolidated Pastoral; agricultural and commodities company Cargill; and Brazil&#8217;s JBS Friboli group, which acquired a stake this year in Australian Meat Holdings. There parties are the same parties interested in AACo the last time around when Citigroup and Caliburn Partnership were also advising Futuris.

			<TEXT>Futuris Corp chief executive Malcolm Jackman said yesterday that the group&#8217;s rural merchandise division, Elders, will be its most prized asset due to its compatibility with grain exporters and traders ABB Grain, AWB or CBH. Mr Jackman said Futuris, to be renamed Elders Ltd, will play a key role in industry consolidation. Futuris is hoping to sell a number of assets before Christmas including a 43 percent stake in Australia&#8217;s largest cattle rancher, Australian Agricultural Co. The company&#8217;s forecast for 2009 has been downgraded 20 percent due to the slump in the financial services, automotive and forestry businesses. Mr Jackman said he would wait for a better time to sell the automotive arm of Futuris including AAco, Webstars and Amcom. Chief financial officer Peter Zachert said cutting down debt and gearing to below 50 percent from its current level of 90 percent would be a chief priority.

			<TEXT>Former Australian Agricultural Co chairman Nick Burton Taylor, recently awarded a Rabobank-sponsored leadership award for agribusiness, proposed a funding boost for AACo from an Asian sovereign fund earlier this year, but was thwarted by key shareholder Futuris. Now, new CEO Stephen Toms has revived the idea in a bid to give the farm manager a much-needed lift. Incidentally, the award given to Burton Taylor shows Rabobank has forgiven AACo for leaving it out in the cold with the sale of Stanbroke Pastoral four years ago.

			<TEXT>Deutsche Bank&#8217;s purchase of a 5 percent stake in Australian Agricultural Company indicates a shift in intentions for the cattle operator, with AACo previously courting a Chinese sovereign wealth fund for a 43 percent stake held by Futuris Corp. Futuris has been trying to offload the stake for months, circumstances that culminated with the ousting of AACo chairman Nick Burton Taylor three weeks ago. As a defence precaution, the board has proposed a $500 million unlisted property fund called the North Australian Agricultural Fund.

			<TEXT>The damages claim against the Futuris Corp-owned Elders rural services business by the Australian Agricultural Company is set to be pulled from the courts after a change in AAco&#8217;s board last week. Futuris, who has a 43 percent stake in AAco, last week forced out chairman, Nick Burton Taylor, which in turn led to the resignation of independent directors, Greg Paramor of Mirvac, and Chris Roberts of Amcor, who left in support of Burton Taylor. Since then, Futuris has appointed former Australian Conservation Foundation&#8217;s Phillip Toyne to the board, and AAco&#8217;s Stephen Tims as acting chief executive.
 Although the damages claim, concerning the supply of cattle from Elders leading to fertility problems in AAco&#8217;s herd, was valued at between $28 million and $40 million, the new board is expected to be more sympathetic to Futuris, given the dispute was understood to be driven by AAco&#8217;s former independent directors.

			<TEXT>The damages claim against the Futuris Corp-owned Elders rural services business by the Australian Agricultural Company is set to be pulled from the courts after a change in AAco&#8217;s board last week. Futuris, who has a 43 percent stake in AAco, last week forced out chairman, Nick Burton Taylor, which in turn led to the resignation of independent directors, Greg Paramor of Mirvac, and Chris Roberts of Amcor, who left in support of Burton Taylor. Since then, Futuris has appointed former Australian Conservation Foundation&#8217;s Phillip Toyne to the board, and AAco&#8217;s Stephen Tims as acting chief executive. Although the damages claim, concerning the supply of cattle from Elders leading to fertility problems in AAco&#8217;s herd, was valued at between $28 million and $40 million, the new board is expected to be more sympathetic to Futuris, given the dispute was understood to be driven by AAco&#8217;s former independent directors.

			<TEXT>Australian Agricultural Company (AACo) boss Nick Burton Taylor has been dumped from the board after major shareholder Futuris voted against his re-election, using its 43 percent stake, because he did not co-operate with its wish to sell its stake. In protest Amcor chairman Chris Roberts and Mirvac chief executive Greg Paramor both left the board. AACos chief financial officer Stephen Toms was promoted to acting CEO in place of Mr Taylor and Futuris appointed Phillip Toyne, former boss of the Australian Conservation Foundation to the board.

			<TEXT>Australian Agricultural Co chairman and chief executive Nick Burton Taylor says he was very surprised to discover that Futuris plans to vote its 42.9 percent stake to oust him from AACo at today&#8217;s annual meeting: I&#8217;d use words such as ambush&#8217;. Futuris has been trying to sell its stake in AACo since last October and is hoping that the removal of Mr Burton Taylor will aid that process. Futuris shares have dropped 16 percent in recent weeks while AACo shares are down 9 percent.

			<TEXT>It appears Australian Agricultural Company chairman Nick Burton Taylor is unlikely to be re-elected to the board at tomorrow&#8217;s annual meeting after losing the support of 43 percent shareholder Futuris Corp. Futuris reportedly wants director Charles Bright to replace the incumbent, contrary to a notice of meeting sent to shareholders. Two independents on the AACo board, Amcor chairman Chris Roberts and Mirvac CEO Greg Paramor, are said to be unhappy about the latest move. It comes after Futuris failed to find a buyer for its AACo stake in a six-month sale process involving Caliburn Partnership, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Mallesons Stephen Jaques. Futuris blames Burton Taylor for stifling any potential deal in his desire to protect shareholders&#8217; interests.

			<TEXT>Hot on the heels of the federal government&#8217;s scuttling of Futuris Corp&#8217;s OPEL regional broadband joint venture with Optus, the company&#8217;s proposed sale of its 43 percent stake in Australian Agricultural Company has been skittled due to lack of interest. Austock Securities says this will affect Futuris&#8217;s balance sheet flexibility while Goldman Sachs JBWere says this will mean higher debt interest in the future. Futuris shares fell 13 percent yesterday.

			<TEXT>Diversified industrial group Futuris Corp has abandoned its plans to offload its 43 percent stake in Australian Agricultural Company (AACo). The news comes a month after the Federal Government terminated Futuris OPEL regional broadband joint venture with Optus, Citigroup and Caliburn Parnership were handling the sale process. James Packer&#8217;s Consolidated Pastoral and Allan Myer&#8217;s Tipperary Group were part of a UBS-advised consortium which were planning to offer $3.50 a share. It is understood that potential private buyers of AACo were held back by the rising cost of debt in the wake of the global credit crunch. The failure of the sale will mean that Futuris is unlikely to be able to engage in merger and acquisition activity anytime soon, for example, increasing its 30.75 percent stake in Forest Enterprises Australia. Futuris shares fell A5 cents to A$2.11 yesterday, while AACo shares dropped A6 cents to close at A$3.13.

None of the proposals arising from the sale process have certainty of execution or timing,&#8217; said Futuris chief executive Les Wozniczka. It is understood that potential private buyers of AACo - including a UBS-advised consortium consisting James Packer&#8217;s Consolidated Pastoral and Allan Myer&#8217;s Tipperary Group - were held back by the rising cost of debt in the wake of the global credit crunch. Shaw Stockbroking has estimated that Futuris&#8217; stake is worth between $300 million and $330 million. Futuris shares fell 5 cents to $2.11 yesterday, while AACo shares dropped 6 cents to close at $3.13.

			<TEXT>The sale of Futuris Corporation&#8217;s 43 percent stake in Australian Agricultural Company may be in sight, after Futuris appointed Citigroup and Caliburn Partners to find a buyer last year. A UBS-advised consortium, including James Packer&#8217;s Consolidated Pastoral and Allan Myer&#8217;s Tipperary Group is said to have put a $3.50 bid on the table. Other companies said to have an interest are Brazil&#8217;s JBS Friboi group, which recently acquired Australian Meat Holdings, and Cargill. However, Macquarie Group&#8217;s pastoral fund is apparently not in the running.

			<TEXT>Futuris Corp has fallen 20 percent since January after its interim result in February was off 8 percent. The seasonal break for winter cropping is the next major news item that can affect Futuris&#8217; standing but this will not be known until mid to late May when 2008 guidance can be calculated. The proposed sale of Futuris&#8217; 43 percent holding in   Australian Agricultural Co will also interest investors.

			<TEXT>Shares in agriculture rural services group,  Futuris Corp, slipped 14c to $2.01 yesterday after the company announced a half-year net profit of $27.5 million. The number was down on last years $33.07 million, but analysts welcomed the maintenance of a 4c fully franked dividend given tough conditions. Drought across much of Australia was blamed for the result, while stormy conditions hit the performance of the insurance business within Futuriss financial services arm. Surprisingly, though, its Elders Rural Services group delivered a 70 percent rise in earnings. Chief executive, Les Wozniczka, remained positive yesterday, predicting Futuris would deliver on its full-year net profit target of $101 million. He also said the sale of Futuriss 43 percent stake in  Australian Agricultural Co was going ahead despite the fact the global credit crunch had scared off a number of interested parties.   
 [But] its a bit like selling the Sydney Opera House: theres only one of its, and we think were going to have a very good outcome, Mr Wozniczka said.

			<TEXT>Australias biggest cattle farmer,  Australian Agricultural Co (AACo), yesterday reported a 31 percent rise in annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation of $41.1 million. Beef production rose 7 percent to 78 million kilograms, while calving rates also improved as drought conditions ease across the country. However, net profit plummeted 64 percent because of a special tax gain the previous year, although the rising Australian dollar also eroded margins. Meanwhile, AACo is hoping the sale of Futuris Corps 43 percent stake to be completed within the next few months, as it looks to ease uncertainty about its ownership structure and fend off competition from overseas markets such as Brazil.

			<TEXT>Listed cattle group,   Australian Agricultural Co (AACo), is trying to find a buyer for the 43 percent holding owned by   Futuris Corp, following a 10 percent slide in AACos shareprice that has seen the stakes value drop to $330 million. Analysts believe AACo may be repositioning itself as a property manager to take advantage of rising food prices and a consequent boom in agribusiness stocks, but according to ABN Amro Morgans Belinda Moore, the market is flying blind about AACos long-term plans. It already owns almost 8 million hectares of land, or about 1.2 percent of Australias landmass, but lags behind largest rival   PrimeAg Australia. PrimeAg floated recently, and has former Woolworths chief executive, Roger Corbett, and former National Farmers Federation head, Peter Corish, as directors. Futuris announced plans to sell the stake in October.

			<TEXT>According to James Packers Consolidated Pastoral Co, the combination of relatively good rain and strong local currency has underpinned earnings growth for the cattle company. The company also said that its value was improving given the rising cost of rural property. Accounts lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission indicate $23.9 million was lost by Consolidated Pastoral for the year ended June 30, 2007, while revenue for 2006-07 increased by 48 percent to $48.9 million. Currently, conglomerate,  Futuris Corp, is preparing to sell 43 percent of Consolidated Pastorals listed proxy,  Australian Agricultural Co, which is expected to fetch over $350 million at the current sharemarket price.

Grain industry rationalisation is still a possibility, however, with representatives from Canadian grain handler   Viterra spotted in Adelaide recently.

			<TEXT>Australian Agricultural Co chief executive Don Mackay has resigned amid Futuris &#8217; efforts to finalise the sale of its 43 per cent stake. The board of AACo is apparently looking for a chief executive with different skills to Mr Mackay. There is speculation, fuelled by the presence of  Mirvac Group managing director Greg Paramor on the board, that AACo may restructure its property holdings to take advantage of rising property values. Chairman Nick Burton Taylor will assume the role temporarily. Austock said the management change would not divert much of the focus from AAco &#8217;s assets. Futuris wants to offload its stake either on the sharemarket or to a strategic shareholder by the end of June.

			<TEXT>A strong run in the shareprice of  Australian Agricultural Company is reducing the chance that any buyer of  Futuris Corporation &#8217;s 42 per cent stake will make a full takeover attempt. Expressions of interest are due to advisors Citgroup and  Caliburn Partnership next week. Possible buyers for the stake include Packer-backed Consolidated Pastoral Company and the Macquarie Group. Meanwhile, it remains unknown if the Futuris-backed Webster participated in the unexpectedly large $67.2 million placement by salmon farmer Tassal this week.

			<TEXT>Soft commodities, which can include everything from wheat to agricultural land, are set to be the next boom sector, replacing &apos;hard&apos; commodities like minerals and metals.  Deutsche Bank and  Macquarie Bank have established specialist funds to adjust to the demand, fuelled largely by expectations around Chinese consumers who - now that they are &apos;comfortably settled into their new apartments...[with the] metal rich consumer items they need - are spending on higher quality food and clothing. Futuris, with a 48 percent share  Australian Agricultural Company has put its stake on the market - comprising cattle-farming land that spans 1 percent of Australia&apos;s land mass. It is likely a full offer will be made by global &apos;agri-giants&apos; San Miguel or Conagra.   
 Richard Elman, chief executive of Hong Kong company Noble Group (and notable for his involvement with small mining companies like Gloucester Coal and Territory Iron), says China and other Asian countries need more of the fundamental elements of a modern society, and someone has to supply them with the raw materials. He says &apos;food is the first thing people spend money on.&apos; Peter Bickley, chief economist at Tilney Private Wealth Investment, is expecting a structural rather than cyclical shift in pricing in the agricultural sector, a statement analogous to the kind made about the resources sector only five years ago. Australian investors looking to make the shift into &apos;soft&apos; commodities will have some difficulties: there are currently 600 companies in mining or &apos;hard&apos; resources while there are only about 60 in the &apos;soft&apos; sector.

			<TEXT>This year has seen many unplanned executive departures, leaving a host of new heads to face tough economic conditions. Australian Shareholders&apos; Association chief executive, Stuart Wilson, says a good chief executive, like David Jones&apos;s Mark McInnes, can deliver results in all conditions. National Australia Bank has named New Zealand head Cameron Clyne to replace CEO John Stewart, shortly after upping its sub-prime exposure provisions by $1 billion. Qantas CEO Geoff Dixon resigned last week: Jetstar CEO Alan Joyce will take over. The credit crunch cleared seats: three Allco Finance Group directors were ousted in March, including executive chairman, David Coe (now an executive); MFS founder, Michael King, resigned after the fund manager&apos;s near-collapse. It struggles on as Octaviar. Santos CEO John Ellice-Flint resigned in March, successor David Knox not named until July. Chairman of Australian Agricultural Company, Nick Burton-Taylor, was voted out by main shareholder Futuris in May.
 In June Futuris announced CEO Les Wozniczka would step down following an earnings downgrade. Aristocrat Leisure CEO Paul Oneile announced his departure a day before a big profit downgrade. Mirvac managing director Greg Paramour stood down in favour of Nick Collishaw after the $240 million freezing of three mortgage funds. Nicholas Moore replaces Macquarie Group CEO and managing director Allan Moss. Paul Fegan replaced St George Bank CEO Gail Kelly, who replaces Westpac CEO and managing director David Morgan. Marius Kloppers replaced Chip Goodyear as BHP Billiton CEO 10 months ago; takeover target Rio Tinto&apos;s CEO Tom Albanese replaced Leigh Clifford last year.

			<TEXT>Economists are divided over whether food supply and land shortages will sustain an investment boom in the agriculture sector, with Deutsche Bank&#8217;s DWS Global Agribusiness Fund manager Bill Barbour confident that demand from China, India, Brazil and Russia will fuel a two-decade boom. Rabobank&#8217;s Neil Dobbin is more cautious, saying droughts have the greatest effect on food prices and weather patterns are difficult to predict. You have to be careful predicting out 20 years - there are too many variables.&#8217; Rabobank, which competes for rural business with National Australia Bank, is hopeful of a bumper crop this year after 10 days of rain over New South Wales recently. DWS, which launched its agricultural fund in 2006, has spread its investments across the globe with a 21 percent weighting in the United States, compared with just 6.15 percent in Australia.
 This is due to a saturated local market with a number of companies heavily exposed to agriculture, including fertiliser producer Incitec Pivot, crop protection firm Nufarm, conglomerate Futuris Corp, wheat marketer AWB, cattle operator Australian Agricultural Company and ABB Grain. Newcomers include Perth-based Burrup Holdings, which is building the world&#8217;s largest ammonia plant on the Burrup Peninsula, and North West Chemical and Fertilisers, while mining magnate Joseph Gutnick is seeking to develop an $850 million phosphate deposit in Queensland to feed India&#8217;s booming fertiliser market. Meanwhile, Adelaide Equity Partners has formed a diversified agriculture investment group that will shortly list on the Australian Securities Exchange. Other managed funds include Lehman Brothers and Schroders, while an alternative to this model is the listed Ark Fund. Ark has an arrangement with MIS vehicle Rewards Group where all landholdings are leased to its partner. Investors in the sector can also examine share-trading platforms such as the Hong Kong Exchange, which launched the RICI Enhanced Agriculture sub-index last month.

			<TEXT>In 2004 Malcolm Bishop moved his family to the Northern Territory to escape drought-affected South Australia, a move which highlights the escalation of agriculture and ranching in Australia &#8217;s north where cheaper land and more regular rain make it easier to service increasing demand for food crops and beef. Consolidated Pastoral, controlled by investor James Packer, said last week that it is anticipating robust capital gains and increased property prices as land owners hasten their expansion plans. Agribusinesses like Cargill in the United States might purchase Futuris &#8217;s 43 percent stake in  Australian Agricultural Company. Food prices have jumped in the past year, with the Australian Farm Institute predicted in December that Asian demand for pork, chicken and beef will leap by close to half by 2020, the equivalent of 86 percent of Australia &#8217;s current output.   
 Mick Keogh, the institute &#8217;s executive director, says demand for maize and sorghum will grow close to 30 percent by 2020, with &#8217;the predominant demand.. both for biofuel and feed grain uses. &#8217; The northern region of Australia is best suited for production of these crops. Rural investment companies like PrimeAg - founded in 2006 by former National Farmer &#8217;s Federation head Peter Cornish and former Woolworths managing director Roger Corbett - are likely to expand their interests in northern Australia, planning to spend the $300 million raised in the initial public offering by the end of the year. The agriculture boom in northern Australia also encompasses horticulture, with the Peanut Company of Australia purchasing close to 12,000 hectares of land on the Katherine River for $8.5 million to take advantage of more reliable water supply in the region. Alex Thamm, national director of consultancy and valuation for Colliers International, says that the value of sugar cane country in Queensland has gone up by a quarter in some parts as recently as 2006. The growing demand for agricultural products is also giving investors an alternative in sluggish equity markets: shares in major Australian agriculture products and services companies have gone up by more than 11 percent since the beginning of 2008, as compared with a 5 percent drop on the S&amp;P/ASX 200.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) executive general manager of agribusiness Jon Sutton says &#8217;people are looking to agriculture as an [alternative] investment. &#8217; Incitec shares have risen 11.5 percent this year, while Nufarm has gone up 6.5 percent. CBA &#8217;s 15-member Agribusiness Index rose 13.5 percent in January. The CBA has also begun re-opening rural branches that closed during the drought.  National Australia Bank is also involved in the action, employing teams of bankers in around 28 communities north of Rockhampton.

			<TEXT>Developing a link between farm and consumer is seen as the key, saysCHRISTINE SALINS.
The way that meat is sold in Australia is cute but archaic, according toPeter Holmes a Court, managing director of Australia&apos;s second largest beefcattle company. Holmes a Court, who took over the reins of the AustralianAgricultural Company late last year, is on a mission to revolutionise thebutcher trade. &apos;It doesn&apos;t matter if it&apos;s our brand or another brand, whatis important is that consumers are able to buy by brand,&apos; he says. &apos;[Beef]is the last consumer product to be sold [generically].&apos; The company listedon the Australian Stock Exchange last year and is aggressively looking toexpand. The eldest son of Heytesbury chairman Janet Holmes aCourt, Peterreturned to Australia in November 2000 after 14 years abroad. After cashingin his inherited 15 per cent share in Heytesbury for $35 million, he is keento prove himself in his new venture. Already, he has flagged his intentionof building the company&apos;s herd from 360,000 head to more than a million by2004, with an aim of achieving lower production costs and greater economiesof scale. Australia&apos;s oldest beef producer, the Australian AgriculturalCompany has a proud 175-year history. Its 19 stations throughout Queenslandand the Northern Territory span 6.5 million hectares of prime cattlecountry. One of the properties, the vast Brunette Downs on the BarklyTableland, last month played host to Operation Outback, in which more than adozen food writers were invited to &apos;Steak your claim. See for yourself whyAustralian beef is the best in the world.&apos; Organised in conjunction withMeat &amp; Livestock Australia, we were flown in to Brunette Downs, which is thelargest pastoral lease in the Northern Territory and one of the largestcattle properties in the world. It was an ambitious exercise, the likes ofwhich had not been undertaken before. Henry Burke and his wife, Bernadette,managers of the station since January, host a never-ending stream ofvisitors to their property but had never dressed for a black-tie dinner ontheir front lawn. As the sun sank low on the horizon, the candles were litand the beautifully dressed tables were graced with a splendid array ofdishes prepared by Aria chef, Matthew Moran, who flew in from Sydneyespecially for the occasion. And yes, the beef was exceptional. Henry Burkeruns a slick operation at Brunette, but willingly volunteers that he leftschool half-way through Year 7, rolled his swag and went to work. One ofeight children, he grew up on a &apos;battler&apos;s block&apos; near Cloncurry and couldbarely read or write before he met Bernadette. All of his skills have beenacquired through sheer hard work and a love of the land. At this specialdinner, Burke sat back in his tuxedo, which Bernadette had hastily arrangedto be flown in from Townsville, and listened to his boss singing hispraises. Burke returned the praise to Holmes a Court. &apos;You&apos;re doing a goodjob,&apos; he said. Then just as quickly, he added &apos;to date&apos; and proceeded tolaugh enormously at his effrontery. No room for egos when there&apos;s work to bedone. &apos;See, these guys keep me on my toes,&apos; said Holmes a Court, whoacknowledges that it is his staff who are the company&apos;s best asset. Jokesaside, Burke, who has worked for the Australian Agricultural Company for thepast 15 years, is grateful for the value the company places on its staff. Ina ground-breaking initiative, the company has set up a program to awardformal qualifications to station managers and head stockmen who, in manycases, run multi-million-dollar businesses without any formal recognition.The Frontline Management Initiative program is conducted by distanceeducation from the Open Learning Institute in Brisbane, and the first 21participants in the program graduated with diplomas of management inOctober. Carmel Wagstaff, who managed Brunette Downs with her husband Geoffbefore the Burkes took over, was instrumental in setting up the program, aworkplace-based assessment framework which recognises competencies held bymanagers and identifies gaps in knowledge where further training may berequired. Wagstaff, named NT Businesswoman of the Year last year, is nowbased in Brisbane where she works as the company&apos;s training and recruitmentcoordinator. Before she left Brunette, she fulfilled her dream of producinga cookbook. The Brief on Beef Cookbook was published in 1999 to celebratethe company&apos;s 175th anniversary. The spiral-bound book contains recipes fromaround 40 company employees including some of northern Australia&apos;s best beefcooks. Many are quite traditional, some even quaint, and a few arereproduced on Page 2. Thirty-five people are employed at Brunette Downs andall live on the station, a cook providing meals for the single employees.The stockmen and women are divided into three stockcamps, two of which workaround 50,000 commercial cattle. The third camp is responsible for a 10,000head bull-breeding herd. Kerryl O&apos;Rourke is head stockwoman for thebull-breeding herd and a typical example of the skilled and passionatejillaroos and jackaroos working on the property. O&apos;Rourke overseas acomposite breeding program which began four years ago and involves thejoining of 1,500 Santa Gertrudis cows with Charolais and tropically adaptedSenepol. The performance of the composite breed will be monitored over thenext two years, and numbers will be increased if there is convincingevidence they are more productive and profitable than pure-bred SantaGertrudis cattle. Brunette still has Australia&apos;s largest herd of pure-bredSanta Gertrudis, a breed introduced 40 years ago by then owner, King Ranch.Over the last few months, the Australian Agricultural Company has taken thefirst few steps in implementing its branding strategy, first with anexpansion into retailing and, most recently, into the food service sector.Its acquisition of a 51 per cent share in Melbourne retailer Polkinghorne&apos;sputs into practice the paddock to plate principle. Rod Polkinghorne andco-director Judy Philpott operate an innovative store in Melbourne&apos;s AlbertPark where they sell fresh meat and employ in-store chefs to produce a rangeof ready-cooked meals. There are plans to expand the business withcompany-owned or franchised stores. Rod Polkinghorne is a cattle producerand experienced retailer, having previously managed Sandhurst Foods andColes Myer&apos;s Rural Operations. He is also an expert in meat grading, havingspearheaded the development of the Meat Standards Australia system, whichuses scientific methods to grade beef according to its tenderness. &apos;[Theacquisition of Polkinghorne&apos;s] provides us with the intellectual firepowerto develop our branding strategy, while also delivering us a flagship retailoutlet and development kitchen in the country&apos;s food capital, Melbourne,&apos;said Holmes a Court. &apos;Polkinghorne&apos;s creates new pathways for AACo productto the consumer, as well as the food-service, restaurant and wholesalemarkets. &apos;Developing the connection between farm and customer is the key, inour view, to building a strong beef brand and is consistent with beefbranding trends evident in overseas markets.&apos; Late last month, the companyformed a joint venture with leading meat processor Nolan Meats, to acquireGriffin&apos;s, a supplier of meat to the food-service industry in Queensland andNSW. Holmes a Court said the move would ensure the company had total qualitycontrol of its beef. Polkinghorne says the company is on the edge of&apos;something that&apos;s spectacularly different&apos;. &apos;The real aim is to lift everypiece of beef and make it as good as it can be. We can make beef an excitingproduct that&apos;s far ahead of any other product out there.&apos;

			<TEXT>Stanbroke sale approved   
SYDNEY:Australian Agricultural Co Ltd is considering whether to press on with a substantial damages claim after the Federal Court ruled the sale of Stanbroke Pastoral Co could go ahead yesterday. AACo said it would consider its options after Justice Ronald Sackville failed to grant an injunction against the transfer of Stanbroke from AMP Life to Nebo Holdings and Investments. AMP Life sold Australia&apos;s largest land holder and cattle producer to Nebo, a consortium of wealthy rural families, earlier for $491million. AACo had been seeking an injunction to stop the sale and have the tender process reopened after its higher bid was rejected by AMP Life. &quot;AACo accepts this ruling and will be giving further consideration to its damages claim against AMP once it has had the opportunity to consider today&apos;s decision,&quot; AACo said after the judgment was handed down. AACo barrister Jason Karas later said there were two aspects to the damages claim - one for the costs of the tender process of about $2million and the other for lost opportunity. The latter is speculated to be about the $100million mark but the company remained tight lipped yesterday about any possible figure. &quot;As for how much the claim ultimately is - if it&apos;s decided to pursue that - that remains to be seen,&quot; Mr Karas said. &quot;I&apos;ll leave that to you to speculate.&quot; AACo had alleged AMP Henderson Private Capital director of operations Marcus Derwin had engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct to get AMP Life to sell Stanbroke to Nebo even though AACo had offered a higher bid of $541million. Under cross-examination last Thursday, Mr Derwin denied that keeping the company together - a move favoured by Nebo - had been a factor in choosing a preferred bidder, despite evidence to the contrary in a company press statement dated September 9. Mr Derwin admitted the press statement was incorrect but said the public had wanted reassurance Stanbroke would be kept together and that there would be no job losses. Justice Sackville ruled yesterday that AACo had failed to establish there was a serious issue to be tried as to whether AMP engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct with regard to the Trade Practices Act. - AAP (Endstory) (Story #495768).

			<TEXT>SYDNEY: The $490million sale of AMP Life&apos;s Stanbroke cattle station to a consortium of graziers and Swan Hill&apos;s Menegazzo family has been put on hold pending the outcome of an injunction application. Peter Holmes a Court&apos;s Australian Agricultural Company Ltd began a legal stoush yesterday with AMP Life and its manager AMP Henderson over the sale of Stanbroke Pastoral Company Ltd to Nebo Holdings. AACo sought an injunction in the Federal Court in Sydney to stop the sale from going ahead and if that fails it could sue AMP for loss of profits. Justice Michael Moore set down the interlocutory injunction hearing for Wednesday next week. Legal counsel for both sides agreed the hearing could be completed in one day. &quot;AMP Life and AMP Henderson have undertaken not to complete the sale before the afternoon of next Wednesday 24 September,&quot; an AMP spokesman said. &quot;Both AMP Life and the buyer, Nebo, were not expecting to complete before this time anyway.   
We&apos;ll be objecting to the AACo application for injunction vigorously.&quot; The transaction was due to be settled 30 days after the announcement of the sale on September 9. AACo submitted two affidavits to the court and AMP Life and AMP Henderson indicated they would not be questioning that evidence. They will not dispute AACo&apos;s evidence that its three tenders worth $491million, $501million and finally $541million, all of which include $81million of debt, were all higher than Nebo&apos;s $490million winning bid. However, AMP&apos;s legal counsel Tom Bathurst told the court there were other aspects to Nebo&apos;s deal which made it more attractive. &quot;The contract was entered into was in fact the best ... offer that was received,&quot; Mr Bathurst told the court. In documents tended to the court, AACo argued AMP Life and AMP Henderson were &quot;in breach of the terms of the process contract&quot; and engaged in &quot;misleading and deceptive conduct&quot; during the tender process. AACo also alleges the AMP companies acted unfairly and &quot;did not accord priority to the interests of the policy holders present and future&quot;. The documents also indicated AACo director Chris Robert had a conversation with AMP Ltd chief executive Andrew Mohl on April 4, 2003, in which he offered to buy Stanbroke shares by private treaty before the tender process began. The initial AACo offer was for between $360 million to $375 million as well as taking on $63 million in Stanbroke debt and merging Stanbroke&apos;s assets with AACo&apos;s pastoral operations. AACo withdrew its initial offer on April 10 and participated in the tender process. AAP (Endstory) (Story #438145).

			<TEXT>FAMILY balance is more important than work life, Tim Fischer said as he stood down from the Australian Agricultural Company Ltd board this week. Mr Fischer will speak about his choices, and work/life balance in rural areas next Saturday at the Men&apos;s Health Promotion Forum held at the National Convention Centre. &apos;&apos;Now and then I get to tipping point, and I need to accept that my work/life balance isn&apos;t healthy,&apos;&apos; Mr Fischer said. &apos;&apos;This is why I stood down from the AACL.&apos;&apos; Having previously been deputy prime
minister, National Party leader and head of numerous boards, Mr Fischer said he had learned ways to maintain a balance between work and life. &apos;&apos;I would say to all men, every now and then, need to take mental stocktake of your schedule, your commitments, your relationships because otherwise you&apos;re going to lose control, go into crisis management which puts your body and your family under a whole raft of stress that you don&apos;t need,&apos;&apos; he said. Mr Fischer said he did not think it was a male-specific problem. &apos;&apos;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a gender thing so much as a baby boomer generation thing,&apos;&apos; Mr Fischer said. &apos;&apos;Up until now, we have not been across what some regard as the soft set of issues involved in maintaining a work/life balance.&apos;&apos; Mr Fischer said he would suggest regular, daily meditation, and setting aside time to plan for the future.
&apos;&apos;Some people are so tied up in responding to emails, writing texts, seeing what the next Big Brother twist is and then the day&apos;s gone,&apos;&apos; Mr Fischer said. &apos;&apos;If you spend the first two hours of every day getting stuck into what you want to do, and planning for the day ahead, life will be that bit easier.&apos;&apos; The Men&apos;s Health Promotion Forum will also include talks from Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia community partnerships and health promotion manager Jo Fairbairn, sexual health expert Rosie King and 18 other men&apos;s health experts. The day has been organised by the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia, with plenty of information about prostate health, cancer, and recovery processes. Tickets are $25 per person but partners and carers can enter free. To book, register by Wednesday, May 28, by calling 1800220099, or visit www.prostate.org.au [http://www.prostate.org.au]

			<TEXT>THERE is more than a touch of irony in the fact that Peter Holmes a Court, eldest son of Robert, the 1980&apos;s &quot;Great Acquirer&quot;, is about to go to work for rural services group Elders. Peter, 31, has taken the job of chief executive of Elders&apos; Australian Agricultural Company, which Elders&apos; parent Futuris Corp is about to spin off, probably through a public float. The ironies lie not only in the fact that AA could possibly become a buyer of some or all of the pastoral holdings of the Holmes a Court family company Heytesbury, which is controlled by Peter&apos;s mother, former Reserve Bank of Australia director and art connoisseur Janet. More pregnant with symbolism is the fact that Elder Smith Goldsborough Mort, as it was called in those days, was an early 1980s target of Peter&apos;s father - who was then emerging from the wilds of Western Australia to become perhaps the 1980&apos;s most audacious corporate raider.
 And later Elders, which resisted Holmes a Court but soon fell victim to John Elliott - as he set out on his own mercurial 80s entrepreneurial journey - came to BHP&apos;s rescue when Robert was within a whisker of winning control of the then Big Australian. Peter Holmes a Court, having sold up the theatre interests in the United States which he built up over the 1990s - and also had his mother and sister buy him out of Heytesbury - has been given the AA job by Alan Newman, Futuris&apos;s enigmatic strongman who in the 80s was Peter&apos;s father&apos;s right-hand man. But it seems unlikely he&apos;ll simply settle down to the hard grind of flogging a basic commodity, beef. More likely he&apos;ll leave that to those down on the farm. Rather, like many before him, Peter seems to see in AA a company that has long undershot its potential. And he hopes to take it on the takeover trail as a catalyst for a major rationalisation of the industry. He joined Newman last week in suggesting there was scope to triple AA&apos;s size to $1 billion over the next few years. Peter told the Australian Financial Review earlier this year he saw his corporate future in identifying opportunities in sectors that were unfashionable with other investors-a philosophy with all the hallmarks of the more astute 1980s movers and shakers. &quot;I think where I&apos;d prefer to be is in sectors which aren&apos;t getting the attention, and where assets are undervalued because they&apos;re not viewed as particularly sexy,&quot; he said then. AA, though it is Australia&apos;s second-biggest corporate cattle baron behind the AMP&apos;s Stanbroke Pastoral Company - with huge land holdings across Queensland and the Northern Territory - certainly, in this age of the &quot;new economy&quot;, isn&apos;t sexy. But it has had its share of suitors.
AA was established in the United Kingdom in 1824. Its pastoral holdings include or have included such famous names as Brunette and Rockhampton Downs in the Northern Territory, Austral Downs, which straddles the NT and Queensland borders and Gregory and Brighton Downs in Queensland. The group owns more than 65,000 sq km of cattle and cropping country and runs some 370,000 head. Both the romance, perhaps, and the potential of these vast holdings, saw a string of players covet AA during the entrepreneurial enthusiasm of the late roaring 80s. In 1987, northern New South Wales pastoralist Ian Boles weighed in with an $88 million bid. Next came NT cattleman Peter Sherwin, whose Sherwin Pastoral Company was a controversial and ultimately ill-fated recent public float. Neither gained any support from AA shareholders. Nor did Australian Metal Holdings, the local company of John Dieter Kahlbetzer, the reclusive multimillionaire and polo aficionado who resided in Argentina, but had extensive Australian corporate interests including a stake of nearly 25 percent in AA.

At that time, insurer Colonial Mutual was AA&apos;s largest shareholder, with a controlling 50 percent. And Colonial was not a seller. The result was a standoff between the insurer and Kahlbetzer, which regularly saw the latter - not in person, but represented by local Minter Ellison lawyer Michael Klug or AMH&apos;s managing director, Christine Campbell - jousting at AA&apos;s sparsely attended annual meetings. The 1990s, however, saw insurers begin to wonder whether investments like AA, whose assets were hardly liquid, and which tended to eat up significant lumps of capital, were really their cup of beef tea. The Sherwin and AMH bids for AA valued it at $98 million. In 1990, AA splashed out more than $20 million to buy the Australian properties of bankrupt Texan oil tycoon Nelson Bunker Hunt, who had come a cropper trying to corner the world silver market. AA recouped some of that, selling up its prime northern New South Wales holdings to concentrate on Queensland and the NT. But for Colonial the price was nearly right. Not long afterwards, it called for tenders for its shares. The tender offer ran into technical problems with Australia&apos;s corporate watchdog, but with Colonial having signalled it wanted to exit, a joint bid by Elders and AMH followed, but an offer by Elders alone, eventually won the day. Elders, however, paid $158 million for AA and Newman now obviously wants some more of that back. Peter, therefore, sees AA becoming the acquirer, rather than the target - and it will be particularly interesting to see if he has his father&apos;s talent on the takeover trail. He said recently he believed a listed AA could use its scrip to bring in landholders keen to turn their acreage into more liquid assets - as Colonial did. He may be right. AXA - the former National Mutual - is in the process of selling down its huge rural holdings, having given up the idea of putting them into a property trust. Meanwhile, Peter, who knows from experience what he&apos;s talking about, also said there were intergenerational transfer issues that some landholders faced which could flush out a number of sellers. Peter earlier this year negotiated his exit from Heytesbury - reputedly after considerable argument with his mother - freeing up a reported $30 million. And what of Heytesbury&apos;s beef operation. Both Peter and his mother say a merger is not on - though Heytesbury last week lost an international arbitration case involving its former subsidiary, construction group John Holland, which could cost it more than $50 million. Janet Holmes a Court said, however, Heytesbury had the cash reserves to meet the arbitration bill without further asset sales. Heytesbury&apos;s recent sale of its London theatre group, Stoll Moss, to Andrew Lloyd Webber&apos;s Really Useful Group, brought in close to $220 million. So Heytesbury Beef may not be on Peter&apos;s shopping list now. But who knows what the future will bring?

			<TEXT>FUTURIS is struggling to lift its share price, even after 11 successive years of profit growth and projections of more growth this year. Shares in the $1.2 billion rural and car component diversified industrial have languished at about $1.60 in September from $2.18 highs late last year. However, analysts said the company&apos;s fortunes may be about to change, starting with yesterday&apos;s 5 rise to $1.70. Chief executive Alan Newman moved to assure shareholders this week that moves on various companies&apos; registers to a 19.5 percent stake in IAMA, 23 percent of Incitec and options in Pacific Dunlop, were done to unlock value and grow the company&apos;s core business. Futuris&apos;s moves to take low-earning assets like Australian Agricultural Company (AACo) off the balance sheet are expected to also gain supporters, according to Salomon Smith Barney client adviser David Robinson. &quot;Once people start seeing some performance on the board, then people will pay attention,&quot; he said.

			<TEXT>THE Australian Agricultural Company (AACo) believes it can sustainimproved first-quarter earnings - achieved on the back of higher cattleprices and sales volumes.
The beef producer&apos;s earnings before interest and tax of $17.1 million,was up strongly from $8.3 million reported in the three months toSeptember 30, 2000.
Shares in the recently listed company closed 5 or 6.2 per cent higherat 86.
AACo chief executive officer Peter Holmes a Court said the result wasachieved on a 42 per cent increase in cattle revenue to $31 million forthe quarter, from $21.8 million in the previous corresponding period.
This rise was due to higher cattle prices, increased sales volumes anda 5 per cent increase in herd values under market value accountingpractices adopted by the company, he said.
Despite worldwide economic softening and specific concerns in theJapanese market, management believed the strong financial performanceover the first quarter was sustainable, contingent upon the continuedstrength of beef prices.
&quot;Accordingly, management believes the company is on track to achieve orpossibly exceed its prospectus forecasts, although it remains too earlyto quantify the full year impact,&quot; Mr Holmes a Court said.
AACo is one of the world&apos;s biggest pastoral companies, running about407,000 head of cattle on 18 stations in Queensland and the NorthernTerritory covering 65,000 square kilometres - about 0.9 per cent ofAustralia&apos;s land mass.
The company recently reported a $2.5 million net profit for the 2000-01financial year.

			<TEXT>CATTLE giant Australian Agricultural Company, which floated two monthsago, is trading more than 25 per cent below its $1 issue price butchief executive Peter Holmes a Court is not perturbed.
Despite forecasting a 2002 net profit up to 15 per cent better thanlast year&apos;s $29.5 million profit, the Futuris spin-off has failed tointerest investors.
Investors have shied away from the world&apos;s only listed cattle company,nervous about exposure to a single commodity, currency fluctuations andmost recently the detection of bovine spongiform encephalopathy - madcow disease - in major Australian beef importer Japan.
With a share price that is hovering just 2 above its record low of 72,Mr Holmes a Court said the company would no longer focus on boostingthe share price but on delivering ahead-of-prospectus forecasts.
&quot;We&apos;ve got to keep our head down and focus on getting results and notworry about share price,&quot; he said.
&quot;If we deliver on those things, then we have got an opportunity to tellour story again.&quot;
After reaching record high prices, the Australian beef industry isbracing itself for the fallout from the mad cow crisis in Japan whichhas seen the country&apos;s beef consumption drop by about 30 per cent. AACoproduces cattle in Queensland and the Northern Territory for sale inAustralia, Japan, the United States, Asia and the Middle East.
The company has focused on producing higher quality grain-fed beef forthe Japanese market under its Emerald Prime brand.
Rather than hurting sales, AACo hopes the mad cow crisis will focusJapanese consumers on the origin and safety of their beef.
According to Mr Holmes a Court, Japanese consumers switched toAustralian beef earlier this year after an E coli O-157 outbreak fromsuspected contaminated American beef.
Australian beef imports in Japan rose 4 per cent while United Statesbeef imports fell 8 per cent.
Beef prices, already down 10 per cent from their recent record levels,are expected to soften further over the next couple of weeks but MrHolmes a Court said the company was prepared.
Investors desert giant cattle group spin-off From Page 25 &quot;We arecoming off such a high base that we are still well ahead of where wesaid we would be (in the prospectus),&quot; he said.
AAC has battled the perception of being a high-risk investment at themercy of commodity prices and exchange fluctuations but Mr Holmes aCourt said disinterested investors did not understand the company.
With a total of 18 properties in Queensland and the Northern Territoryspread over land the size of Europe, Mr Holmes a Court said he believedthe geographical spread of the properties should address investors&apos;concerns about the group&apos;s lack of diversification.
Mr Holmes a Court visited Queensland&apos;s Gulf country last week to sign amemorandum of understanding with Aboriginal-owned Mar Mar PastoralCompany.

			<TEXT>FUTURIS Corp will raise roughly $200 million on the spin-off of its beef arm, Australian Agricultural Co, next month, according to sources close to the deal. The prospectus is due out in three to four weeks, with Futuris expected to take up to a 40 per cent stake in the company when it lists in July.
Credit Suisse First Boston and JB Were have been appointed joint managers for the sale. Futuris subsidiary Elders Australia acquired Australia&apos;s second oldest company in an at-times bitter $158.3 million takeover battle in 1995. &quot;Futuris believes it&apos;s time to give the company a separate identity and separate access to the capital market,&quot; the source said. &quot;It&apos;s clearly very well managed and this will give it an opportunity to grow fast both in the Australian and world market.&quot; The once-Queensland-based pastoral company is Australia&apos;s second largest, comprising 6.5 million hectares and almost 400,000 head of cattle in Queensland and Northern Territory. Australia and AAC&apos;s structural advantages in beef production, the low Aussie dollar and the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in parts of Europe are expected to auger well for the float. AAC chief executive Peter Holmes a Court, who flagged the float last October, would not comment on the specifics of the IPO. &quot;We made the decision in October last year and since that time conditions and circumstances have reinforced our decision,&quot; he said yesterday.

			<TEXT>FUTURIS&apos;S beef arm, the Australian Agricultural Co, is on track for a July listing, chief executive Peter Holmes a Court said yesterday. AAC has appointed a chief financial officer, lead managers for its book-build to institutions and retail investors. Futuris would also take up to a 40 per cent stake, Mr Holmes a Court confirmed. Full-year pre-tax earnings would be about $25 million compared with $44.5 million after a revaluation of its herd and new accounting standard. Beef prices remain high, thanks to a low Australian dollar but in a global sense, in US dollar terms, they are &quot;at a reasonable level&quot;. AAC would reduce climatic risk through acquisitions but was likely to pay a premium for good properties that would add value to its existing 6.5 million hectares and 380,000 head of cattle in Queensland and the Northern Territory. The company would also reduce its mix of exports from 65 per cent to 50 per cent as it focused on marketing beef to domestic buyers.
 The season so far has produced good rain on all properties.

			<TEXT>SHARES in cattle group  Co Ltd (AACo) could continue their slide today with the company having exhausted all its market stabilisation avenues.
Intervention by broker Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) over the past two weeks has failed to stop AACo shares dipping 12 per cent below their issue price despite a well supported initial public offer.
Since listing, AACo shares have fallen 12 to close on Friday at 88, compared with an issue price of $1 for retailers and $1.10 for institutions.
CSFB last Thursday bought almost 4.72 million AACo shares, taking the total it has purchased to 16.632 million - the maximum allowed under AACo&apos;s market stabilisation arrangements.
A Brisbane-based stockbroker, who declined to be named, said the performance of the stock since listing had been &quot;extremely surprising&quot;.
&quot;No one could get shares in the float and now no one wants them ... it is a very strange market,&quot; she said.
&quot;Without CSFB in the market, the shares will probably come under more pressure (today).&quot;
AACo debuted at 99 and peaked at $1.04 on August 10 following a $127 million capital raising.
Talking after the float, AACo chief executive officer, Peter Holmes a Court, said he had expected a relatively slow opening to trade, with investors looking for a stag profit swamping the market.
&quot;There was always going to be a lot of volume in the market and that was going to put a pressure on the price,&quot; he said. &quot;There were a lot of people looking for a stag on the first day.&quot;
AACo was spun-off by rural group Futuris Corp Ltd, which will retain a 30.39 per cent stake in the company.
The company is Australia&apos;s second oldest company and owns more than 380,000 head of prime beef cattle on 18 stations, covering about 65,000 sq km in Queensland and the Northern Territory.
Most market watchers had predicted a strong secondary market for the company after overwhelming demand for shares forced Futuris to release an extra $8 million worth of shares into the float.
Its performance is at odds with another recent agricultural offering, the unglamorous AWB which has caught the imagination of Australian investors.
The monopoly wheat exporter ended its first week as a listed company with a market capitalisation of $1.1 billion as investors poured into the stock.
AWB shares - issued at $3.15 - closed up 25 to $4.05.
Given what had happened with AACo, the expectation was for AWB to debut on par.
&quot;It surprised a lot of people ... consensus was it would list around $3.30, $3.40 but it&apos;s just kept bolting,&quot; a Sydney-based dealer said.

			<TEXT>THE cattle kings at Australian Agricultural Company Ltd have acquired achain of meat pie shops as they extend their &quot;paddock to plate&quot; strategy.
AACo executives looked at just about every pie operator in the country andate a lot of pies, in their quest to find the right acquisition.
AACo has bought Perth-based The Jesters Jaffle Pie Co - a which has 31owner-operator franchised stores in Western Australia and a licensed NewZealand store - for $2 million to $3 million in cash and equity.
The deal is in line with AACo&apos;s strategy which aims to maximise the value ofits beef herds through the acquisition of downstream businesses.
It complements last November&apos;s purchase of Melbourne beef retailerPolkinghornes and the formation in April of a food services joint venture tosupply beef to pubs and restaurants in Queensland and NSW.
Formed in 1997, Jesters has tapped the growing popularity of more healthconscious fast food alternatives by promoting its use of low fat, lean meatin its 15 pie varieties.
&quot;These are low-fat high quality pies.
&quot;Jesters is all about healthier fast food to compete against the existingfast food operators,&quot; AACo chief executive Peter Holmes a Court saidyesterday.
The low-fat, high-beef content policy also maximises Jesters&apos; use of beef -one of the major attractions for AACo when it came looking.
AACo said the Perth stores were expected to turn over $10 million thisfinancial year.
It will derive its income from royalties and the supply of cookedingredients to franchise outlets from a centralised bakery.
Mr Holmes a Court intends to use Perth as a springboard for the expansion ofJesters into other states, beginning with Victoria and Queensland and hetalks about the potential for a couple of hundred outlets across the nation.
&quot;It&apos;s gone to 31 stores in three and a half years and we want to expand itand get the same penetration across the east coast,&quot; he said. &quot;That&apos;s whatwe&apos;re about.&quot;
However, AACo intends to tred carefully and is wary about being tied to atimetable.
For the time being, AACo is looking no further than securing a presence inMelbourne and Brisbane.
AACo shares closed 2 higher yesterday at 94.

			<TEXT>CATTLE company Australian Agricultural Co Ltd warned yesterday its earningsmay fall as much as 20 per cent in 2002-03 as lower beef prices anddrought-related costs rein in margins.
The beef producer said its 2002-03 result was &quot;unlikely to exceed&quot; its2001-02 outcome as it expected lower cattle sale prices to continue, withhigher costs for feed and grains.
AACo also said there were signs of a recovery in export prices after a yearof volatility for the worldwide industry, which had suffered from mad cowdisease scares and foot and mouth outbreaks that hit demand.
The 178-year-old cattle producer yesterday reported its first full-yearprofit as a listed company. Net profit for the June 30, 2002 year was $20.6million, 2 per cent shy of its prospectus forecast.
The result was ahead of the $8.7 million reported in the previous financialyear. While the cattle group admits challenging conditions prevail, it saidthe fundamental drivers for growth remained unchanged and it was actively onthe hunt for acquisitions.
One of the world&apos;s largest cattle companies, AACo&apos;s revenue for 2001-02 was$93.96 million, compared with a $90.3 million prospectus forecast and upfrom $82.4 million in the previous year.
AACo executive officer Peter Holmes a Court said at this early stage,earnings in 2002-03 were not anticipated to exceed 2001-02. &quot;AACoanticipates that earnings may be in the vicinity of 10 per cent to 20 percent below the FY2002 outcome,&quot; he said.
Earnings before interest and tax in 2001-02 were $32.7 million, short of the$35.7 million prospectus forecast. AACo declared a fully franked finaldividend of 6.08 a share.
The company finished the year with a record 407,000 head of cattle, locatedon 18 cattle stations across Queensland and the Northern Territory. AACoheld back beef sales in the year to take advantage of rising markets andfinished with 33,000 more cattle than forecast.
It said its geographic diversity spanning almost 1 per cent of Australia, inmostly monsoon areas, helped protect it from the severe drought grippingparts of NSW and Queensland.

			<TEXT>INTERNATIONAL tourists should be able to enjoy a five-star outbackexperience in Queensland as early as next year with Australia&apos;s newestcattle king, Peter Holmes a Court, setting his sights firmly onvalue-adding.
Mr Holmes a Court, chief executive of the Australian Agricultural Company,said an operator would be appointed soon to launch the &quot;authentic outbackexperience&quot;.
Expressions of interest have already been called and the joint venturelinking AACo with the R.M. Williams brand is on track for lift-off within amatter of months.
Visitors can expect to stay on the company&apos;s cattle stations in luxuriousclimate-controlled tents, dine on the finest cuisine and wines and samplesuch outback delights as barramundi fishing and working cattle.
It would be the Australian version of an upmarket African safari.
&quot;(The outback) is a unique part of Australia which is under-utilised,&quot; MrHolmes a Court said.
He said the luxury ecotourism experience fitted well with his othervalue-adding strategies involving the company&apos;s rural holdings.
These included the new &quot;1824&quot; flagship aged beef brand and plans tofranchise a line of beef outlets along a similar line to Lenards poultryshops.
The eldest son of Janet and the late Robert Holmes a Court said the 1824brand celebrated AACo&apos;s status as the nation&apos;s oldest agricultural business,founded in 1824.
Today the company manages a herd of more than 400,000 head on 19 cattlestations throughout Queensland and the Northern Territory.
Mr Holmes a Court said the brand initiative was part of changing the companyto a modern beef and food company producing clean, healthy beef for domesticand international consumers.

			<TEXT>LOWER June quarter cattle price expectations have forced AustralianAgricultural Co Ltd to peg back its 2002 net earnings forecasts.
After posting a $28.14 million first-half net profit in February, AACoincreased its full-year earnings before interest and tax forecast to $43.7million, 23 per cent more than its prospectus forecast of $35.7 million. Netprofit was revised up to $28.1 million for the year, 33 per cent more thanits prospectus forecast of $21.1 million.
The group yesterday warned it would not meet those forecasts due to lowercattle price expectations for the final quarter.
Full-year EBIT was brought back to $37 million and net earnings to $23.3million, 3.7 per cent and 9.9 per cent respectively more than prospectusforecasts.
AACo said cattle sales (both number and timing), cattle sale prices in thefourth quarter and cattle prices at June 30, 2002 remained critical to itsfull-year result.
However, chief executive Peter Holmes a Court said that beef prices hadstabilised in the past two months and were expected to remain around currentlevels for the remainder of the calendar year.
AACo&apos;s revised earnings coincided with a 25.6 per cent improvement in EBITfor the nine months to March 31, 2001 to $22.9 million, compared with $18.23million in the corresponding period last year.
The result was built on a 17.4 per cent lift in revenue to $85.8 million.

			<TEXT>THE Australian Agricultural Co Ltd (AACo) has added another bolt-on to its&quot;paddock to plate&quot; strategy with the addition of a partnership to providehigh-end meat cuts to domestic restaurants.
Chief executive of the 178-year-old cattle company, Peter Holmes a Court,said AACo spent a &quot;modest amount&quot; to create a joint venture company, ChefsPartner. The partnership of AACo, together with Gympie abattoir Nolan Meatsand meat industry identity Pat Dempsey, yesterday announced the acquisitionof Griffin, a Brisbane supplier of high-quality meats to the food servicemarket.
About 20 per cent of AACo&apos;s domestic beef sales already go to Griffin forfinal preparation and distribution. The deal signed late Monday, for anundisclosed amount, was expected to reap $10 million in annualised sales forthe joint venture by year end 2003.
Mr Holmes a Court said Griffin was a &quot;best in class&quot; provider of meats torestaurants, hotels and other food service outlets throughout Queensland andNSW.
This new company will be jointly owned by AACo (45 per cent), Nolan Meats(45 per cent) and Pat Dempsey (10 per cent).
&quot;We have attracted the top people in each of the areas,&quot; Mr Holmes a Courtsaid. &quot;We were looking for the best but we were specifically looking for aQueensland business that gave us the geographical proximity link to ourstations.&quot;
While ruling out acquiring its own meatworks, the AACo chief executive didnot dismiss the idea of the company one day running its own steakrestaurants.
&quot;We don&apos;t want to get into competition with our customers but there areexamples of branded beef businesses that have restaurants as a flagship, soit is not inconceivable,&quot; said Mr Holmes a Court.
&quot;But the priority at this stage is on the supply.&quot;
He said the most important element of the latest joint venture was thetransformation that AACo was making from a producer to an integrated beefcompany.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIAN investors risk missing out on the growth in demand forhigh-quality export beef created by overseas health scares, according to theAustralian Agricultural Company Ltd.
AACo chief executive Peter Holmes a Court said Australian institutionalinvestors continued to see local cattle as &quot;hamburgers on sticks&quot;, despitetheir ability to deliver high-quality lean beef to markets hit byfoot-and-mouth and mad cow diseases.
He said the Australian beef industry was in danger of heading the same wayas the country&apos;s pork producers, who opened up lucrative markets inSouth-East Asia only for the profits to head overseas.
He told an American Chamber of Commerce lunch in Sydney: &quot;Who owns the valueadd in Australia? Wise foreign investors who are capturing the value addpremium (on pork) and it&apos;s going out of the country.&quot;
Mr Holmes a Court said AACo sold $120 million in beef exports a year but bythe time it reached consumers, the value had increased to about $1.5billion. Beef producers had to establish a relationship with their customersif they wanted to extract maximum value from their products.
AACo is already experimenting in that area with the Polkinghorne&apos;s butchershop in Melbourne, which sells premium quality branded AACo beef.
Mr Holmes a Court said AACo hoped to franchise the brand nationally andpossibly internationally.
Australian beef needed to shed its old-fashioned image and identify itselfas a lean, healthy, environmentally friendly alternative to chicken andfish.
He said Australian agricultural producers had an advantage over foreignrivals because they did not employ intensive farming practices and were notthreatened by diseases such as foot and mouth.
AACo shares closed down 1c at 92c.

			<TEXT>FARMING, as an investment, is booming. Soaring wool, sheep and cattle pricesplus a bumper grain crop have spurred interest in rural stocks.
All of a sudden farming is &quot;sexy&quot;, but it is the old guard companies thatare benefiting, according to industry experts.
The stock exchange listing last year of companies such as the AustralianAgricultural Company and the AWB, formerly the Australian Wheat Board,raised the profile of agribusiness among city investors.
AWB came on to the market at $3.42 and went as high as $4.88. It closed onFriday at $4.40. GrainCorp shares have risen 30 per cent in three months.
Investment bank JB Were said last week it would be leading grain marketerABB Grain&apos;s push on to the stock exchange.
Australia&apos;s largest malting barley seller is keen to raise up to $30million. ABB expects investors to jump at the opportunity, given thediscount it trades at compared with rural peers.
Stuart Kelly, client adviser with broking house Joseph Palmer &amp; Sons, saidthe whole rural sector had suddenly become a &quot;little bit sexy again&quot;.
There were two reasons for this. The first was that after the death of manytech stocks, people were looking for solid investments.
&quot;People have begun looking for companies which have proven themselves over arelatively long period of time,&quot; he said. &quot;Investors are looking forcertainty of earnings - a solid asset base.&quot;
The second reason rural stocks were popular was due to record seasons inmost farm sectors.
&quot;It&apos;s been a bloody good couple of years for farmers,&quot; Mr Kelly said.
JB Were managing director, corporate finance, John Paterson said there hadbeen a &quot;resurgence of investor interest&quot; in agribusiness stocks.

			<TEXT>CATTLE producer Australian Agricultural Co has beaten expectations with itsmaiden interim profit but warned Mad Cow fears in Japan could dampen itssecond-half result.
AACo, which listed on the Australian Stock Exchange last August, yesterdayposted an interim net profit of $28.14 million for the six months toDecember 31, 2001.
It was up 136 per cent on the $11.9 million profit booked in the previouscorresponding period and 33 per cent up on its full-year prospectus forecastof $21.1 million.
Chief executive officer Peter Holmes a Court said with a flat second halflooming, AACo&apos;s full-year net profit was now expected to be 30 per cent morethan the prospectus forecast.
&quot;Softening prices caused by the outbreak of BSE (mad cow disease) in Japanhave caused us to conservatively assume a 7.5 per cent drop in cattle pricesin the third quarter, with no change assumed in fourth quarter,&quot; he said.
&quot;This means that very strong cash flows will be met by a marked marketreduction, meaning our full-year result will be approximately where we standtoday.&quot;
The company expects to pay a fully franked dividend in October this year. Nointerim dividend was declared.
While strong demand and high beef prices helped bolster the company&apos;shalf-year profit, Mr Holmes a Court said concern about BSE in Japan latelast year had dented export demand.
&quot;Global demand rose dramatically in the first six months and prices finishedthe year in the region of 25 per cent higher than where they were at thestart of the financial year.
&quot;Even with some price softening from BSE in Japan, it is still above wherewe started the year,&quot; he said.
&quot;Cattle prices in January 2002 have been approximately 5 per cent to 7 percent lower than at the end of December 2001 and we expect them to remainvolatile for the rest of financial year.
&quot;But Australian beef is well placed to recapture the Japanese market asdemand improves later this year.&quot;
Mr Holmes a Court said AACo&apos;s herd was now a record 408,000 cattle due togood seasonal conditions and an increase in breeding productivity.
&quot;The beef sold in the six months rose 14 per cent to 14 million kg at$3.38/kg compared with $2.80 in the previous corresponding period,&quot; he said.
&quot;The global supply has been restricted by spiralling land costs and diseaseoutbreaks. But beef consumption continues to increase as population andaffluence grows.
The US herd, the largest determinant of cattle prices, is at its lowestlevel for six years and young cattle prices are at their highest level in 14years.&quot;
Key upcoming projects include the &quot;de-commodification&quot; of beef, bydeveloping branded beef through AACo&apos;s share of Melbourne&apos;s Polkinghorne&apos;sboutique butchery, and a joint venture with R.M. Williams Holding Ltd tocreate a tourism business.
AACo&apos;s earnings before interest and tax for the December half were $41.2million, an increase of 142 per cent over the previous corresponding period.Revenue rose 65 per cent to $70.12 million.
AACo&apos;s result augured well for its 40 per cent owner Futuris Corp Ltd, whichreports its half-year profit tomorrow.
Shares in AACo closed 2 weaker at 93 yesterday, while Futuris finished up 1at $1.91.

			<TEXT>A 500,000-hectare cattle property in far north Queensland is about to becomethe face of Outback Australia for international jetsetters.
Wrotham Park station, population 20, is home to about 30,000 head of brahmancattle.
But in a year&apos;s time the cattle property, 250km northwest of Mareeba, in farnorthwest Queensland, will be uttered in the same breath as Bedarra andLizard Islands as a luxury holiday destination.
The Australian Agricultural Company-owned property is about to betransformed into the first site for Authentic Outback Tours - a jointventure between Australian Agricultural Company, RM Williams and a yet-to-benamed third-party operator.
Wealthy overseas tourists are expected to pay up $4000 a night for anall-inclusive stay in a wood-floored, air-cooled, electric-powered tent.
They will be fed the best Aussie beef, drink the best Australian wines andbe clad in authentic RM Williams gear should the desire arise.
&quot;This is going to be on a par to the great African safaris ... this will beheld in our spectacular properties, only a short hop from Cairns,&quot; AACochief executive Peter Holmes a Court said.
&quot;Visitors can get the Barrier Reef experience and then go on to have anOutback experience.
AACo sees tourism as a way for the commodity company to diversify usingcapital the business already owns.
&quot;We&apos;re a commodity company but we can use the capital to transform thebusiness ... in case cattle prices go down,&quot; Mr Holmes a Court said.
Wrotham Park was chosen as the first of AACo&apos;s 19 properties for the venturedue to its proximity to Cairns and the Great Barrier Reef.
RM Williams chief executive officer Hamish Turner said he believed Outbacktourism remained underdeveloped and that there was real demand for highquality tours.
&quot;Reginald Murray Williams, the founder of RM Williams, has long recognisedthe uniqueness of the stockman experience, one of vast spaces and hard work,but also incredible beauty and environmental balance,&quot; Mr Turner said.

			<TEXT>PETER Holmes a Court&apos;s Australian Agricultural Co&apos;s shares slipped 3 percent yesterday after news that Australia&apos;s beef exports to Japan slumped inDecember.
The slide in exports has reinforced the view that cattle prices, whichsoared last year, must fall significantly in the current 12 months.
Exports in December crashed to about 13,000 tonnes, from more than 25,200tonnes in December 2000, in the wake of a slump in Japanese consumer demandfor beef following the discovery of three cases of mad cow disease in thecountry.
AAC shares, floated to the public at $1 each, declined after theirstockmarket debut in August to hit a low of 72 after the September 11 USterrorist attacks.
But aided by a solid first-quarter earnings report, they had fought theirway back to 97 as new year trading began.
The stock dipped 3 to 90 yesterday.
AAC reported a strong first-quarter result, with earnings before interestand tax of $17.1 million, up from $8.3 million in the previous correspondingperiod.
The result was achieved on a 42 per cent increase in cattle revenue from$21.8 million to $31 million.
Higher cattle prices, increased sales volumes, an increase in herd value andunder-market-value accounting practices, all helped the result.
Excluding the herd revaluations, AAC&apos;s underlying earnings before interestand tax increased from $4.3 million to $10.3 million.
After the first quarter, AAC expressed confidence that it would meet itsprospectus forecast - of at least a 20 per cent profit improvement - for thefull year.
AAC said at the time: &quot;Despite worldwide economic softening and specificconcerns in the Japanese beef market, ACC management believes the strongfinancial performance over the first quarter is sustainable&quot;. That was&quot;contingent upon the continued strength of beef prices&quot;, the company noted,however.

			<TEXT>SHARES in beef exporter Australian Agricultural Company Ltd jumped nearly 5 per cent yesterday after last week&apos;s news the US had reported its first case of mad cow disease.  
AACo shares finished 6, or 4.9 per cent, higher at $1.29 in a stronger overall market with more than 2.4 million shares traded.  
The rise was on top of a near 13 per cent increase after the case was first reported on Christmas Eve last week.  
&quot;It is just a supply/demand factor I suppose with the mad cow disease coming back into realisation, AACo is going to have clean beef basically,&quot; Wilson HTM private client adviser Myles Smith said.  
&quot;The demand for it is going to enable them to really increase their margins . . . but it all depends on just how long it lasts and to what extent it has affected the cattle industry.&quot;  
In the US last week, the Government confirmed a sample from a suspect cow had been sent to Britain for testing.  
It has since been confirmed the cow was suffering from mad cow disease.  
Locally, the Government has imposed a temporary ban on American beef products because of the case of mad cow disease.  
Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), has been linked to a fatal brain-wasting disease in humans and caused huge losses for the European beef industry in the 1990s.  
The only previous outbreak in North America was a single case of BSE at a farm in Alberta, Canada in May.  
US Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman told a Washington press conference last week that the country was in the process of alerting its trading partners and other organisations of the case of BSE.  
The cow was from a farm in Mapleton, about 65km southeast of the Washington State town of Yakima.  
The farm has been quarantined.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIAN Agricultural Co&apos;s Rural Management Partners has snared a deal to manage the Cooplacurripa cattle property in southeastern Australia.  
RMP said the 22,560ha property, which runs about 7000 cattle, was acquired by a private investor, while AACo bought the cattle.  
The total sale price, including both the property and cattle, was more than $16 million.  
AACo will lease the property from the private investor, with the whole operation to be managed by RMP.  
RMP managing director Chris Evans said the acquisition enabled private investors, who might not have the capital or expertise to buy and manage large cattle operations, to invest in beef production.  
He said RMP planned to develop a series of rural property and cattle investment funds in the near future and pursue further acquisitions on behalf of potential investors.  
AACo slid 1 to $1.33 yesterday.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIAN Agricultural Co will consider suing for damages after it yesterday &quot;comprehensively lost&quot; its bid to block the sale of AMP Life&apos;s cattle unit.  
The Federal Court yesterday dismissed AACo&apos;s request for an injunction to stop the $491 million sale of Stanbroke Pastoral Co to Nebo Holdings and Investments.  
AACo was the underbidder when AMP Life sold Australia&apos;s largest land holder and cattle producer to Nebo, a consortium of wealthy rural families, last month after a five-month tender campaign.  
AACo had been seeking an injunction to stop the sale and have the tender process reopened. But Justice Ronald Sackville yesterday said AACo had failed to establish AMP had engaged in &quot;misleading and deceptive conduct&quot; in the Stanbroke sale.  
Also, he said, it would be &quot;inappropriate&quot; to grant an injunction that adversely affected the rights of Nebo, whose investors include Hungry Jack&apos;s burger chain founder Jack Cowin.  
AACo had alleged that AMP Henderson Private Capital director of operations Marcus Derwin colluded with Stanbroke&apos;s Peter Hughes to get AMP Life to sell Stanbroke to Nebo for $491 million, even though AACO had offered $541 million.  
Discussing who should pay court costs, Justice Sackville said that AACo had &quot;comprehensively lost&quot; its application for an injunction. Outside the court, Jason Karas a lawyer for AACo Ltd, said that while an appeal on the injunction was not on the cards, he would not rule out suing for damages. It was earlier reported AACo was considering a damages claim of more than $100 million against AMP Life if it did not win an injunction.  
Asked how he felt about the court&apos;s decision, AACo chief executive Peter Holmes a Court said: &quot;We didn&apos;t come here to spoil. We came to have . . . the merits of our offer considered in the full light in front of the court.  
&quot;We believe we did that. It was established our offer was the highest offer. That&apos;s what we sought to do. We uncovered a substantial amount of information and we have a lengthy and complex judgment to review before we make a consideration as to what our steps may be.&quot;  
Mr Hughes could not be contacted last night. The long-serving Stanbroke director stood aside once AMP began its tender campaign.  
He is now a 25 per cent shareholder in the Australian consortium formed to buy Stanbroke, which includes Victorian farmer Peter Menegazzo, three private Queensland farming families and Mr Cowin.  
Mr Menegazzo said the consortium was pleased the battle was over and &quot;AACo needs to accept they were beaten fairly in their bid for Stanbroke&quot;.  
AMP chief executive Andrew Mohl said AMP was pleased with the decision. &quot;The court found there was no evidence that AMP failed to give priority to achieving the best price, contrary to AACo&apos;s claims,&quot; he said.  
&quot;The competing bids were properly considered by AMP Henderson and Nebo provided the superior offer.&quot;  
The 40-year-old Stanbroke&apos;s assets span 11.70 million ha in north and west Queensland and the Northern Territory. It has 27 operating cattle properties, 500,000 cattle and vertically integrated beef and food operations.

			<TEXT>AMP Life may have lied to the public about the reasons behind choosing the Nebo Holdings consortium as the successful bidder for its Stanbroke cattle empire.  
The Federal Court yesterday heard claims that there was an error in a press release from AMP Henderson, AMP&apos;s Life investment manager on September 9 this year when it announced the $490 million sale to Nebo.  
Peter Holmes a Court&apos;s Australian Agricultural Company Ltd, which made a higher offer than Nebo, is seeking an injunction from the court to stop the sale being completed and have the tender process reopened. AACo&apos;s lawyers yesterday questioned AMP Henderson Private Capital director of operations Marcus Derwin about why he said in the press release that one of the factors in choosing Nebo over rival bidders was because Nebo intended to keep Stanbroke as an &quot;ongoing concern&quot; and not break it up.  
The statement also appeared in an internal AMP document drawn up the day before the press release was issued to the media on September 9.  
Under intense cross-examination by AACo&apos;s barrister Douglas Meagher, QC, Mr Derwin gave a series of vague answers to questions about the accuracy of the statement and whether AMP had lied to the public and its policyholders.  
He eventually admitted the statement was &quot;factually incorrect&quot;, that &quot;price, price and price&quot; was the most important factor in determining the successful bidder and that the $50 million difference between AACo&apos;s offer and Nebo&apos;s bid was &quot;negligible&quot;.  
He also revealed that he had never told AACo that keeping Stanbroke as an ongoing concern would be a factor in determining who to sell Australia&apos;s biggest land holder and beef producer to.  
However on further examination by Justice Ronald Sackville, Mr Derwin appeared to backtrack on his previous answers.  
Justice Sackville asked: &quot;Did I understand your previous answer correctly that you agreed that the statement was incorrect?&quot; Mr Derwin replied: &quot;If I did I have probably done so incorrectly. That statement should stand.&quot;  
Mr Derwin later told Mr Meagher that he meant to convey in the press release that the jobs of hundreds of Stanbroke&apos;s staff were safe even though Nebo had bought the business and the deal was &quot;a win&quot; for AMP.  
He denied that he was against Stanbroke merging with AACo, which had proposed such a deal as far back as March this year.  
However he did admit to drawing up Nebo&apos;s final offer document to submit to AMP.  
Mr Derwin said he prepared the document based on a conversation with representatives from Nebo.  
Earlier, lawyers for AMP and Nebo expressed outrage at allegations of collusion made against their clients on Wednesday.  
AACo had accused Mr Derwin of colluding with Stanbroke director and Nebo representative Peter Hughes to get AMP to sell Stanbroke to Nebo for a price less than AACo&apos;s offer.  
AMP Life&apos;s barrister Tom Bathurst QC yesterday argued that the allegations were serious and urged Justice Ronald Sackville to have them withdrawn. Nebo barrister John Sheahan SC said the allegations had &quot;absolutely no foundation&quot;.  
The case continues.

			<TEXT>AN AMP Henderson executive allegedly colluded with a Stanbroke Pastoral Company director to sell the cattle company to Nebo Holdings for a price less than a rival bid, a Sydney court was told yesterday.   
The allegations were raised in the Federal Court as Peter Holmes a Court&apos;s Australian Agricultural Co Ltd began arguing for an injunction to stop Stanbroke being sold to Nebo, a consortium of wealthy rural families, and have the tender process reopened. AACo alleged that AMP Henderson Private Capital director of operations Marcus Derwin colluded with Stanbroke&apos;s Peter Hughes to get AMP Life to sell Stanbroke to Nebo earlier this month for $490 million, even though AACo had offered $541 million.   
Mr Derwin was also a director of Stanbroke at the time while Mr Hughes was part of the Nebo consortium, headed by Hungry Jacks hamburger chain founder Jack Cowin and five rural families in Queensland.   
AACo&apos;s barrister Douglas Meagher, QC, alleged that Mr Derwin and Mr Hughes colluded after meeting on September 4 to discuss the sale.   
Five days later AMP Henderson, which manages AMP Life, announced that the cattle company had been sold to Nebo, despite AACo increasing its offer from $491 million to $501 million and finally $541 million.   
Mr Meagher claimed that after AACo increased its offer early on September 5 to about $500 million, Mr Derwin drafted a fresh offer document for Nebo to sign and submit to AMP Life.   
Nebo signed the document and sent it back to AMP Life about 7.30pm, after Mr Derwin had left his office.   
Mr Meagher said Mr Derwin returned to the office about midnight and accepted Nebo&apos;s offer on behalf of AMP Life.   
&quot;We would say that what was happening at that stage was there was anxiety (to conclude the) sale to Nebo, lest my client come back with an even better offer again and if that is right . . . this wasn&apos;t advancing the interests of (AMP Life) policyholders,&quot; Mr Meagher said.   
&quot;This was ensuring Nebo would get the contract, notwithstanding (the higher AACo offer).&quot;   
AMP Life has vowed to vigorously defend its decision to sell Stanbroke to Nebo.   
AMP Life&apos;s barrister Tom Bathurst, QC, said yesterday that AACo&apos;s court action was &quot;designed to frustrate&quot; the sale process because AACo &quot;didn&apos;t put its best foot forward during the tender process&quot;. He added that there was not a &quot;scintilla of evidence&quot; to support the claims made against Mr Derwin.   
He said that while Mr Holmes a Court had increased his offer on September 5, because the sale was being conducted through a tender process there was &quot;no obligation on Mr Derwin at that stage to do any more whatsoever&quot;.   
After Mr Holmes a Court increased the offer, Mr Derwin spoke to him and asked if that was his final price and was told it was, Mr Bathurst added. However, according to documents submitted to the court last week, AACo ultimately lifted its bid again to $541 million.   
The interlocutory hearing before Justice Ronald Sackville continues.

			<TEXT>THE $490 million sale of AMP Life&apos;s Stanbroke cattle stations to a consortium of graziers and Swan Hill&apos;s Menegazzo family has been put on hold pending the outcome of an injunction application.   
Peter Holmes a Court&apos;s Australian Agricultural Company Ltd (AACo) yesterday began a legal stoush with AMP Life and its manager AMP Henderson over the sale of Stanbroke Pastoral Company Ltd to Nebo Holdings.   
AACo sought an injunction in the Federal Court in Sydney to stop the sale from going ahead and if that fails it could sue AMP for loss of profits.   
Justice Michael Moore set down the interlocutory injunction hearing for Wednesday next week.   
Legal counsel for both sides agreed the hearing could be completed in one day.   
&quot;AMP Life and AMP Henderson have undertaken not to complete the sale before the afternoon of next Wednesday September 24,&quot; an AMP spokesman said.   
&quot;Both AMP Life and the buyer, Nebo, were not expecting to complete before this time anyway. We&apos;ll be objecting to the AACo application for injunction vigorously.&quot;   
The transaction was due to be settled 30 days after the announcement of the sale on September 9.   
AACo submitted two affidavits to the court and AMP Life and AMP Henderson indicated they would not be questioning that evidence.   
They will not dispute AACo&apos;s evidence that its three tenders worth $491 million, $501 million and finally $541 million, all of which include $81 million of debt, were all higher than Nebo&apos;s $490 million winning bid.   
However, AMP&apos;s legal counsel, Tom Bathurst, told the court there were other aspects to Nebo&apos;s deal that made it more attractive.   
&quot;The contract that was entered into was in fact the best . . . offer that was received,&quot; Mr Bathurst told the court.   
In documents tendered to the court, AACo argued AMP Life and AMP Henderson were &quot;in breach of the terms of the process contract&quot;, and engaged in &quot;misleading and deceptive conduct&quot; during the tender process.   
AACo also alleges the AMP companies acted unfairly and &quot;did not accord priority to the interests of the policyholders present and future&quot;.   
The documents also indicated AACo director Chris Robert had a conversation with AMP Ltd chief executive Andrew Mohl on April 4 this year in which he offered to buy Stanbroke shares by private treaty before the tender process began.   
The initial AACo offer was for between $360 million and $375 million as well as taking on $63 million in Stanbroke debt and merging Stanbroke&apos;s assets with AACo&apos;s pastoral operations.   
&quot;Mohl advised Roberts that AMP was not prepared to sell the Stanbroke shares by private treaty rather than by tender . . . in order to obtain the best price for the Stanbroke shares,&quot; the documents revealed.   
AACo withdrew its initial offer on April 10 and participated in the tender process.   
Under the sale to Nebo, Peter Menegazzo, a grain grower and owner of four Gulf of Carpentaria cattle stations, would emerge with a half-share of Stanbroke, while Hungry Jack&apos;s Jack Cowin would have a 25 per cent stake.   
Peter Hughes, speaking on behalf of Nebo, declined to comment on the action.

			<TEXT>BEEF producer Australian Agricultural Company (AACo) yesterday forecast up to 25 per cent net profit growth for the 2004 financial year despite announcing a slump in earnings for the year past.   
AACo&apos;s net profit after tax for the 2003 year was $18.3 million, down 11 per cent or $2.3 million from its 2002 result of $20.6 million.   
The company also confirmed yesterday it was confident of raising the required funds to buy the country&apos;s largest cattle firm, Stanbroke Pastoral Co, from the insurance arm of embattled finance group AMP.   
AACo is one of a handful of suitors for the company, which has half-a-million head of cattle and is expected to sell for more than $500 million.   
AACo chief executive Peter Holmes a Court said he was confident investors would support the company in its investment plans.   
&quot;Should we make the right investment, I am confident that we would be able to interest our shareholders and new shareholders in taking equity in that asset,&quot; he said.   
For the 2003 year revenue grew by $22 million, or more than 23 per cent, to $116 million, driven by an increase in its herd from 407,000 to 418,000 and strength in its grain-fed cattle sales.   
But an increase in operating expenses offset the growth in revenue, with the drought inflating grain and cattle costs.   
Feedlot cattle expenses swelled more than 50 per cent from $13.6 million to $20.7 million, while employee expenses rose 34 per cent to $21.2 million.   
Despite the difficult trading conditions, AACo generated earnings per share of 9.6, while its full-year dividend was 6 a share, down only 0.08 on 2002.   
Mr Holmes a Court said the company&apos;s ability to trade through tough external conditions was the best news to come out of the annual results.   
&quot;I believe that we had a good story to tell, particularly about our future prospects, our good balance sheet, and the record herd,&quot; he said.   
&quot;And I think the story of managing through really tough conditions speaks volumes on the strength of the company.&quot;   
Mr Holmes a Court said the key to the company&apos;s relative success through one of Australia&apos;s worst ever droughts was positioning for when the drought ended.   
&quot;Droughts end. Every one has. Knowing that, when other people are forced to sell down their herds, if you&apos;ve got the capacity to trade through, you can put yourself in a strong position for when you come out of the drought,&quot; he said.   
&quot;It&apos;s been reported the Kidmans&apos; cattle company sold down their herd 20 per cent and it&apos;s been reported that Stanbroke sold their herd down 12 per cent. We&apos;ve been able to keep and grow our herd.&quot;   
Mr Holmes a Court said a return to normal seasonal conditions, predicted increases in domestic cattle prices, falling grain prices and a stronger Australian dollar were all external factors likely to make 2004 a good year for the company.   
There was no evidence recently imposed Japanese beef tariffs would substantially impact on export revenue.   
Shares in AACo surged 8 or nearly 8 per cent to $1.12.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIAN Agricultural Co will put Stanbroke Pastoral Co under themicroscope after making the shortlist to buy the AMP Life-owned cattlecompany.
Stage two of the tender process comprises due diligence in Stanbroke, whichhas attracted the interest of buyers as far away as Indonesia, Brazil andGreece.
AACo said yesterday no agreements have been entered into at this stage topurchase Stanbroke.
&quot;Any suggestion that AACo will make a final bid for, or be the successfulacquirer of, Stanbroke is entirely speculative,&quot; AACo said.
Stanbroke comprises 27 cattle stations spread across Queensland and theNorthern Territory and other assets.
In an update to the market yesterday, AACo said its net profit forecast forthe current year remained unchanged although it expected to sell fewer cowsthan previously anticipated.
Last month, AACo forecast its net profit for 2002-03 would be about 10 percent below its previous record of $20.6 million.
It said yesterday that as a result of current conditions, it had decided todefer sales of some cattle for a number of weeks to take advantage ofanticipated price rises.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIAN Agricultural Company (AACo) confirmed yesterday it - &quot;along withhalf of Queensland&quot; - had lodged an expression of interest for StanbrokePastoral Co and expected to find out by as early as tomorrow whether it hasmade the short list.
Greek shipping tycoon Gregory Hadjieleftheriadis has also thrown his hat inthe ring to buy the portfolio of 27 cattle stations stretched across almost12 million hectares of Queensland and the Northern Territory.
Ray White Rural managing director Lex Heinemann, who is acting as an agentfor Athens-based Mr Hadjieleftheriadis, yesterday said there were probablyup to six other parties who had tendered to buy Stanbroke in one parcel.
Mr Hadjieleftheriadis, who owns the company Alice Springs Pastoral, alreadyhas extensive cattle interests in Australia.
Those rumoured to be keen to get a closer look at the AMP Life-ownedbusiness include Kerry Packer&apos;s Consolidated Pastoral Company, KidmanHoldings and the Holmes a Court family&apos;s Heytesbury Beef.
Mr Heinemann said more than 30 other groups were probably interested inparts of the company.
AACo executive director of operations Don Mackay said his company hadprovided an expression of interest &quot;along with half of Queensland&quot;.
&quot;But we&apos;re not definite buyers, we are just one of a number looking to takethe opportunity that has come along,&quot; he told an ABN Amro Morgans businessbriefing yesterday.
But he said that he expected there would be &quot;a lot of non-conformingexpressions of interest&quot; for Stanbroke.
&quot;(Stanbroke) is a big corporation. It&apos;s been a corporation for 40 years,&quot; hesaid after the briefing.
&quot;If you take the pieces of it out you still have got a corporation left witha lot of residual liabilities and commitments and things so it is not aneasy task to break it up.
&quot;They&apos;ll want to maximise returns to policy holders and at the same timeensuring that it&apos;s dealt with appropriately as a business.&quot;

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIAN Agricultural Company officially tossed its hat into the cattlering yesterday as a potential bidder for the Stanbroke Pastoral Company -its largest industry rival, owned by AMP Life.
AMP Henderson, which manages Stanbroke on behalf of AMP Life, announced onTuesday that the sale of the country&apos;s largest beef producer would be put totender to assess expressions of interest from a number of domestic andoffshore parties.
Elaborating on comments by its managing director, Peter Holmes a Court, AACofired a statement off to the Australian Stock Exchange yesterday confirminginterest in buying Stanbroke - which has some 500,000 head of cattle and 27properties covering 11.7 million hectares throughout Queensland and theNorthern Territory.
&quot;We understand that AMP is now contemplating a tender process for thisbusiness,&quot; said Australia&apos;s No 2 cattle owner, which has 400,000 head and6.5 million hectares across a portfolio of 19 properties - about half ofwhich are near Stanbroke ranches.
&quot;AACo will consider the terms of any AMP tender and may express an interestin the business, depending on the terms of the tender and the outcome of anyreview of the business that we undertake. Any suggestion that AACo willacquire this business is entirely speculative.&quot;
Other potential bidders for the company estimated to be worth up to $550million include Kerry Packer&apos;s Consolidated Pastoral Co, Janet Holmes aCourt&apos;s Heytesbury Beef and John Kahlbetzer&apos;s Twynam Group.
Ray White Rural head Lex Heinemann, who sold Strathmore, a Stanbroke stationin the Gulf, for $15.3 million last May, told The Courier-Mail yesterday hewas already handling two potential bids for Stanbroke - both with differentagendas.
&quot;One is a syndicate of individuals who want to buy the properties and splitthem up while the other, an offshore investment fund, wants to buy theStanbroke name and continue to run the company using the same management andstaff with minimum fuss,&quot; he said from the firm&apos;s Goondiwindi office.
After dashing away to answer his mobile telephone, Mr Heinemann was quicklyback on the line apologising. &quot;Sorry about that - I thought it might havebeen Kerry trying to get me,&quot; he quipped.
AACo shares closed down 2 at 89. AMP edged 8 higher to end the day at $7.01,reflecting the impact of the FTSE&apos;s 71.5-point, or 2 per cent, gainovernight Tuesday in London.

			<TEXT>AMP confirmed last night that it would put its Stanbroke Pastoral Company onthe market, in what will amount to Australia&apos;s largest-ever sale of ruralproperty assets.
Potential buyers for the $500 million-plus portfolio of beef cattleproperties include the Australian Agricultural Company, controlled by PeterHolmes a Court, and Kerry Packer.
Mr Holmes a Court, at least privately, has said in the past that he would beinterested in any Stanbroke assets that were ever offered for sale.
AMP said last night that it would offer the Stanbroke assets - spanning 27cattle properties in Queensland and the Northern Territory and covering atotal of nearly 12 million hectares - for sale by tender.
AMP says it is not selling the assets as a result of its disastrous groupfinancial performance in recent months, but rather to realise value formembers of AMP Life, through which Stanbroke is held.
One close observer said AMP was merely testing the waters. Other reportshave suggested, however, that AMP needs to top up its liquid funds to meetstatutory requirements.
Stanbroke is one of the most vertically integrated companies of its type inthe world, incorporating every stage of beef production through to theabattoir - or &quot;from paddock to plate&quot;, as Stanbroke likes to put it. Much ofits product is sold under the Diamantina brand.
It is the largest beef producer in Australia, and - with a herd of some500,000 cattle - also one of the largest in the world.
As well as the obvious Australian candidates, the tender is also expected toattract considerable international interest.
The tender is to be managed through AMP Henderson Global Investors, whichmanages the Stanbroke assets for AMP Life.
In 2001 Stanbroke recorded a profit of $92.1 million, about a third of whichwent directly back to AMP, although earnings for 2002 are expected to bereduced because of the prolonged drought.
Stanbroke was formed in 1964. AMP took full control of the company 20 yearsago.
AMP shares have been on a long and slippery slide this year since the groupannounced a loss of $900 million for calendar 2002.
The shares closed 9 weaker yesterday at $6.93.

			<TEXT>Beefing up the nuptials SO it looks like Russell Crowe will be enjoyingsome decent Queensland beef at his forthcoming nuptials.
QC hears his good mate Peter Holmes a Court - who just happens to runAustralian Agricultural Company - may well be sending Crowe a fewdecent sides of the good stuff.
The pair have been mates for years and we reckon Holmes a Court will beattending the special chapel wedding at Crowe&apos;s NSW rural retreat.
A fancy feast for customers GOOD goss. QC has heard that BMW isplanning a pretty fancy affair for the launch of its new 760 seriesnext week.
Seems Brisbane BMW&apos;s Martin Roller and Marvin Burke are taking a few oftheir customers to the exclusive five-star event at Gold Coast&apos;s MarinaMirage. So what.
Well, star chef Neil Perry from well-known Sydney hot spot Rockpoolwill be cooking up a feast and Wendy Matthews might drop in to sing asong or two for the lucky few. Should be big.
Good golly, it&apos;s Molly! IT was a blast from the past at Hotel LA onFriday, thanks to B105. Countdown King Molly Meldrum jetted into townas the special guest DJ for B105&apos;s &quot;Best of the &apos;80s and &apos;90s party&quot;.More than 300 revellers were caught in a time warp as the man with thebig hat spun the vinyl on tunes by Wham and Rick Astley and forgettableclassics such as The Macarena.
It all adds up to a good time THE Brisbane City Council&apos;s secret weapon- its CFO Helen Gluer. She may not be a household name but Gluer wasunanimously voted Australia&apos;s funniest bean counter after herperformance at the recent Australian Institute of Management&apos;sInternational Women&apos;s Day Debate. Gluer and her cohorts, Channel 7sport&apos;s Victoria Carthew and Assistant Queensland Police CommissionerKath Rynders, wiped the floor with their opponents to win the argument&quot;that women need to crack the code to open doors&quot;. The affirmative teamgot a standing ovation (which included being pelted with dinner rolls)for its fractured performance of an Alice in Wonderland fairytale thathad Carthew strip off her power suit to reveal an Alice frock, Gluerdon a rabbit mask and Rynders resplendent in a Mad Hatter bonnet. Lineof the day went to Gluer, though, who had more fans flocking around herafter the event than Bruce Springsteen. On the issue of contraception:&quot;I&apos;m an accountant so my personality usually does it for me&quot;.
Jerry gives us love, not war THANKS to Channel 10 for keeping it real:yesterday as war news broke, surprising absolutely no one, Ten stuckwith a different annoying American, Jerry Springer. (Yesterday&apos;s forum:&quot;I&apos;m in love with your mama.&quot;) Know something we don&apos;t?

It&apos;s simple really -the Liberals have shut the gate on nominations for Moggill, where deWit might have once thought about standing but decided to stay on inthe Brisbane City Council as opposition leader. Well, Moggill has comeand gone and now de Wit is no longer opposition leader either. But shereckons she is happy to keep batting for the people of Pullenvale as acouncillor, and given she pulled a whopping 67 per cent of the vote outthere last time round, who can blame her? So who is set to replaceDavid Watson out in Moggill? Preselection takes place on April 12, ifyou want to put it in your diary.
Oh brother late and live IF you think the war is ugly, wait until yousee the latest instalment of the Big Brother franchise as fronted byGretel Killeen, pictured. QC understands there&apos;ll be a charmingtwo-hour episode that will go &quot;live to air&quot; at midnight for the benefitof those who like their viewing to verge on the pornographic. The badnews: Home Shopping will be two hours shorter.
Aussie anchors A LITTLE moment of antipodean pride yesterday when CNN,beaming to millions, had as its anchors Australian television graduatesStan Grant and John Vause.
Frew waiting by the phone HOLLYWOOD here we come? Marissa Frew hopesso. The up-and-comer has been hanging around the phone this weekwaiting to hear how she went with her latest audition, the big flashnew TV project, the yet-to-be-named afternoon children&apos;s show forChannel 9. Frew, pictured, whom we suggest should adopt a hyphen andbecome Frew-Frew to really crank up her acting prospects, bowled up toNine for her audition the other day and stood out among the 300-oddothers who&apos;d turned up. &quot;I thought, oh God. It&apos;s so daunting,&quot; Frewtold QC. Not as daunting as if you actually get the job, dear. One of20 to get a call-back, Frew trekked up Mt Coot-tha again late last weekfor a 45-minute audition for a panel of three which included the show&apos;sproducer, old Out of the Box host Brett Annable. Luckily Frew alreadyhas a job at girly Brisbane boutique Bellissima, and with a millionOscars&apos; parties on Monday a girl&apos;s got plenty to keep her mind off allthe other stuff going on.

			<TEXT>Leasings FIVE months after paying $7.05 million for the former Brown &amp; Rootoffice building in Milton, private investor Peter Kurts has attracted one ofBrisbane&apos;s oldest companies to a whole-floor lease.
The Australian Agricultural Company is moving its 50 employees to level oneof 299 Coronation Drive. AACo is Australia&apos;s oldest agricultural company andthe country&apos;s second-largest beef producer, managing 400,000 cattle across19 properties in Queensland and the Northern Territory.
AACo&apos;s commercial manager Philip Marwedel said the preference for the Miltonlocation arose from a combination of easy access, good rail, bus, ferry,restaurant and communications infrastructure.
Other issues in favour of the Milton precinct included the river outlook andproximity to the CBD.
&quot;AACo places great store in its people and the ambience of the CoronationDrive premises was important in allowing our staff to feel good aboutthemselves,&quot; Mr Marwedel said.
Staff will move in to the 900sq m premises, which includes balconiesoverlooking the Brisbane River and the CBD, in May, relocating from thePrimac Building at 109 Melbourne Street.
AACo engaged consultants Kerger Architects and Younger White to realise adesign concept for the premises. Kerger Architects is designing a mix ofopen plan offices and meeting rooms. Work areas flow to informal staff areasand balconies, which will also serve as client entertainment areas.Furniture will be supplied by Schiavello Commercial Interiors.
The building is owned by Ronim Pty Ltd, a privately owned company by PeterKurts. Mr Kurts bought the property off market last year and has sincecarried out some refurbishment, particularly in the ground floor lobby.
Asking rentals within the building are $285/sq m for a whole floor. RichardAkero represented Ronim in negotiating the lease with Bernie McKeering ofPRDnationwide in conjunction with Peter Cullen-Ward from ChestertonInternational.
Mr McKeering said that level one suited AACo ideally as it could occupy thewhole floor comfortably. &quot;The building offers a competitive rental level andhas an excellent car parking ratio of about one car bay per 40sq m.
&quot;Interest in the building has been strong as larger offices frontingCoronation Drive with river views are now in scarce supply.&quot;
Other tenants in the building include Computer Learning on the ground floorand Intergraph on level three. It is understood that PRDnationwide hasanother tenant negotiating to lease level two. * * * ONEIDA Australia, theworld&apos;s largest manufacturer of stainless steel and silver-plated flatware,has taken a five-year lease on a 136sq m Harbour Town store on the easternface of the centre, facing Oxley Drive.
The company is set to launch a move into brand direct retailing in Australiawith the opening of its first factory outlet store at Harbour Town on theGold Coast.
Oneida Australia&apos;s sales and marketing director Greg Kennedy said HarbourTown, with its reputation as the nation&apos;s premier outlet shoppingdestination, was the perfect location for Oneida&apos;s brand direct debut.
&quot;Oneida has 21 factory outlets currently operating in the UK and they havebeen hugely successful, but this is a first for the operation here inAustralia,&quot; he said. &quot;As opportunities are presented, we will be looking forfurther sites in Sydney and Melbourne.&quot;
The new Oneida Factory Outlet at Harbour Town is due to open this month.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIAN Agricultural Company yesterday reassured investors it was ontrack to meet its full-year profit forecast despite posting an 87 per centfall in half-year net profit.
In the six months to December 31, AACo generated a profit of $3.78 million,compared with the $28.14 million recorded a year earlier. The group said themain discrepancy between the two results was due to the self-generating andregenerating assets accounting standard which means its earnings wereaffected by beef prices and the timing and number of cattle sales.
Cattle prices appreciated 4.7 per cent in the half compared with a 15.5 percent life in the previous corresponding period. Revenue during the periodfell 39 per cent to $42.5 million.
AACo chief executive officer Peter Holmes a Court yesterday said the pastsix months was one of the toughest periods ever experienced by theAustralian cattle industry.
&quot;The outbreak of BSE in Japan, the US quota issue and the drought inAustralia of 100-year severity hit the industry as a whole,&quot; he said. But hesaid the company would meet its previously flagged full-year forecast of 10to 20 per cent less than the 2002 result of $20.6 million.
He said many of the company&apos;s properties had received encouraging rainfallsin recent weeks.
&quot;AACo expects average cattle prices to continue the upward trend experiencedin the first-half of the 2003 financial year,&quot; he said. &quot;It is wellpositioned to take advantage of rises in cattle prices due to a strongbreeding herd and improved breeding productivity. In the medium term, weexpect Asian beef and live cattle demand to rise, higher US cattle pricesdue to US herd rebuilding and generally higher cattle prices from restrainedglobal beef supplies.&quot;
Mr Holmes a Court said he expected a return to double-digit earnings growthin 2004.
The company did not declare an interim dividend, but is expected to pay athird-quarter dividend of less than 2 a share.
AACo&apos;s herd numbers stood at 393,000 at December 31, 2002, down 4 per cent.
AACo&apos;s shares shed 1 to 88 yesterday.

			<TEXT>PETER Holmes a Court has taken a significant step in his efforts tovalue-add to Australian Agricultural Co&apos;s beef herd, a step that may beginto convince investment markets that the group&apos;s branded beef strategy can beof more than marginal value to the company.
AACo yesterday announced a 10-year exclusive beef supply contract, throughits 45 per cent-owned Chefs Partner joint venture, with international foodservice group Bidvest.
The two companies said the alliance would allow Bidvest, which has 40,000restaurant, hotel and institutional customers across Australia, to offerquality-assured beef and other meats, with Bidvest estimating the alliancewould have sales of $20 million in its first year and $100 million annuallywithin four years.
That compares with current Chef Partners turnover which Mr Holmes a Courtsaid yesterday was running at $10 million a year. South African-controlledBidvest is an international food service group listed in Luxembourg and onthe Australian Stock Exchange, with major operations in South Africa, the UKand New Zealand, as well as being Australia&apos;s largest food servicedistributor.
Mr Holmes a Court and Bidvest Australasia&apos;s managing director Bernard Bersonsaid the alliance between the two groups created Australia&apos;s first &quot;paddockto plate&quot; food service alliance.
They said the deal would allow Bidvest to offer its customers, and ChefPartners&apos; existing 180 clients, quality assurance and consistency in qualityin meat supply. Bidvest offers a range of 35,000 items - from food andaccompaniments to cooking and cleaning products - through 21 distributioncentres serviced by a fleet of 350 temperature-controlled trucks and a salesforce of morfe than 250 to hotels, restaurants and institutions - fromhospitals and nursing homes to the defence forces and prisons.
Mr Berson said that Bidvest customers would be able to choose from threegrades of Chefs Partner product, plus AACo&apos;s premium 1824 brand beef.

			<TEXT>Stock:Australian Agricultural Company Advice:Strong buy Analyst:PeterStrachan, D J Carmichael Despite news of a second &quot;mad cow&quot; infection inJapan, sales of Australian beef into Japan are running at about the samelevels as were seen last year.
During October, weekly sales of Australian product fell around 40 per centyear-on-year compared with sales of local and US sourced meat, which fell byaround 80 per cent.
By early November, sales of Australian product had recovered to normallevels while total sales in Japan were still languishing, down 60 per centon last year.
Clearly the market is distiguishing between Australian product and productfrom the rest of the world.
While AAC&apos;s December quarter result is unlikely to be as strong as theSeptember quarter, the cattle company looks set to significantly outperformits prospectus profit estimate of 11.2c a share for financial year 2002.
A strong buy.

			<TEXT>THE recently-floated Australian Agricultural Company expects a 10 percent rise in cattle prices to boost its 2001-2002 profit result.
If the present demand continued, the company would exceed its forecastprofit of $21.1 million, chief executive Peter Holmes a Court saidyesterday.
But the latest forecast failed to revive AACo&apos;s share price.
The stock fell 2c to 82c yesterday. They were issued to retailinvestors at $1 and to institutions at $1.10.
AACo, which made its stock exchange debut on August 10, is one of theworld&apos;s largest cattle producing companies and the second-largest beefcattle producer in Australia.
AACo just beat its prospectus forecasts for earnings before interestand tax with $29.5 million for the year to June 30.
Excluding the impact of cattle herd revaluations, under theself-generating and regenerating assets accounting standards, grossearnings rose 27 per cent to $32.8 million. The previous year&apos;s resultwas helped by a $26 million upward revaluation of the cattle herd.
The profit was achieved on revenues of $81.9 million, compared toprospectus forecasts of $81.1 million.
Cattle sale numbers were 120,619, down about 13.000 on the previousyear, with the reduction attributed to the impact of an extended wetseason which restricted stock movements as well as delayed live exportshipments.
Mr Holmes a Court said the strong earnings and a cash flow of $17million reflected the strengthening of the beef market &quot;as well as goodoutcomes from our herd management and breeding programs&quot;.

			<TEXT>SHARES in Peter Holmes a Court&apos;s Australian Agricultural Co were expected to continue their slide today after its brokers exhausted their market support facility.
In a so-called &quot;greenshoe&quot; operation, broker Credit Suisse First Boston has bought 16.6 million shares in the cattle group in two weeks.
That is the limit set in the group&apos;s supplementary prospectus for market stabilisation.
But CSFB&apos;s buying failed to stop AACo shares dipping below their issue price.
The shares, issued at $1 to retail investors and $1.10 to institutions, closed at 88c on Friday.
AACo was spun off by rural group Futuris Corp, which has retained a 30.39 per cent stake.
The company is Australia&apos;s second oldest and owns more than 380,000 head of prime beef cattle on 18 stations.

			<TEXT>THE cattle kings at Australian Agricultural Company Ltd (AACo) have boltedon a chain of Perth pie shops as its extends its &quot;paddock to plate&quot;strategy.
AACo executives looked at just about every pie operator in the country, andate a lot of pies, on their quest to find the right acquisition.
AACo has bought The Jesters Jaffle Pie Co, which has 31 owner-operatorfranchised stores in Western Australia and a licensed New Zealand store, forsomewhere between $2 million and $3 million in cash and equity.
From today, Jesters&apos; 100 per cent beef pies will be made with AACo beef.
Chief executive of the 178-year-old beef producer AACo, Peter Holmes aCourt, said the deal signed was expected to reap $10 million in salesturnover in 2002-03.
Jesters receives royalty income as well as earnings from the supply ofcooked ingredients to the franchised stores.
&quot;The reality is we have the ability through Jesters to grow a significantproportion - 30 to 50 per cent - of our non-grilling cuts to enable us tovalue-add that meat at the highest percentage possible,&quot; he said.
AACo shares firmed 2c to 94c.

			<TEXT>THE Farm Bill signed by US President George Bush this week to the alarm ofmany Australian agricultural producers won&apos;t deter Peter Holmes a Court&apos;sAustralian Agricultural Company.
Mr Holmes a Court told the Australian Stock Exchange the bill should notaffect his high quality beef sector.
&quot;And in fact (it) will assist us by reducing grain prices, grain being oneof our significant inputs,&quot; he said.
Mr Holmes a Court also welcomed signs of recovery in Japanese beef importswhich fell after the outbreak of BSE disease there last September.
&quot;There are very clear signs of a recovery in demand from Japan, which is nowin the region of 70 per cent of its pre-BSE levels. We believe the market ison track to reach 80-90 per cent by the end of the calendar year.&quot;
However, Mr Holmes a Court said AACo did not depend on Japan for highquality beef sales, with good demand here and in the US.
&quot;Our natural production system means we&apos;re in the most desirable category,producing very clean beef for the market,&quot; he said.
&quot;Many other beef producing countries have suffered food scares and areseeing the cost of production rise, resulting from high land and labourcosts due to their intensive farming practices.&quot;

			<TEXT>LOWER cattle price expectations have forced Peter Holmes a Court&apos;sAustralian Agricultural Co to peg back its 2002 earnings forecasts.
After achieving a $28.14 million first half profit in February, AACoincreased its full-year gross earnings forecast to $43.7 million, 23 percent above the $35.7 million prediction in the prospectus.
Net profit was revised up to $28.1 million for the year, 33 per cent abovethe prospectus forecast of $21.1 million.
But the chief executive, Mr Holmes a Court, yesterday warned the companywould not meet those forecasts because of lower cattle price expectationsfor the final quarter.
Full-year gross earnings were brought back to $37 million and net earningsto $23.3 million, 3.7 per cent and 9.9 per cent respectively aboveprospectus forecasts.
AACo&apos;s share price closed 1c softer at 81c.

			<TEXT>HE doesn&apos;t have a beef with it. In fact, Peter Holmes a Court loves chicken.
But the head of the recently listed Australian Agricultural Company isn&apos;tfoxing about his intentions.
He&apos;s preparing to tackle the chicken industry head-on.
Watch the feathers fly.
Beef was being sold in largely the same way it was 40 years ago, Mr Holmes aCourt said yesterday.
Across the world, consumption of beef had fallen steadily over the past 20years, while chicken had improved production and consistently marketeditself better than beef.
&quot;I&apos;m a fan of chicken, it&apos;s a good meat product,&quot; he said.
&quot;It&apos;s convenient. It&apos;s consistent. It&apos;s easy to cook for families. Thatshould be what beef producers are doing.&quot;
But Mr Holmes a Court, speaking at a an American Chamber of Commerce inAustralia luncheon, said the chicken industry might be losing its `king ofthe coop&apos; tag.
Per-capita consumption of chicken in the US had dropped since 1995, MrHolmes a Court said.
Also, the white meat&apos;s &quot;clean, healthy choice&quot; image may have suffered amidconcerns about the use of antibiotics in chickens.
Beef had not been without its share of problems in recent times, Mr Holmes aCourt was quick to point out.
The mad cow outbreak in Japan had hurt demand for beef. One-third of the 34million kg of beef AACo sells a year is shipped into Asia.
On top of this, there are indications between 20 and 40 per cent of all beefcattle producers in Europe would leave the industry within the next fiveyears, he said.
&quot;Beef is about as beaten up as a consumer product could possibly be,&quot; hesaid.
AACo was therefore keen to use some of the chicken industry&apos;s own marketingnous.
&quot;People are seeing beef is a good protein and iron source for ... leading anactive life,&quot; he said.
&quot;Far from the old image of a fat piece of meat, beef is a clean proteinsource: the ultimate functional food.&quot;
Australians also needed to change their perception of where the best beefcame from. That cattle from northern Australia were &quot;wild woolly cattle&quot; or&quot;hamburgers on sticks&quot; was a fallacy.
&quot;The idea that in the cheapest capital environment we can produce thehighest quality beef scares a lot of people. It&apos;s a very exciting thing.&quot;

			<TEXT>CATTLE producer Australian Agricultural Co has beaten expectations with itsmaiden interim profit but warned Mad Cow fears in Japan could dampen itssecond half result.
AACo, which listed on the stock exchange last August, yesterday posted aninterim net profit of $28.14 million for the six months to December 31,2001.
This was 136 per cent higher than the $11.9 million profit in the previouscorresponding period and 33 per cent up on its full-year prospectus forecastof $21.1 million.
Chief executive officer Peter Holmes a Court said with a flat second halflooming, AACo&apos;s full year net profit was now expected to be 30 per centhigher than the prospectus forecast.
&quot;When we listed we said we were setting out on a marathon and we&apos;ve startedoff at a sprint,&quot; he said of yesterday&apos;s results.
No interim dividend was declared but AACo expects to pay a fully frankeddividend in October this year.
While strong demand and high beef prices helped bolster the company&apos;s halfyear profit, Mr Holmes a Court said concern about BSE (the human form of MadCow disease) in Japan in late 2001 had dented export demand.
&quot;Global demand rose dramatically in the first six months, and pricesfinished the year in the region of 25 per cent higher than where they wereat the start of the financial year.
&quot;Even with some price softening from BSE in Japan, it is still above wherewe started the year,&quot; he said.
&quot;Cattle prices in January 2002 have been approximately 5 per cent to 7 percent lower than at the end of December 2001. &quot;But Australian beef is wellplaced to recapture the Japanese market as demand improves later this year.&quot;
Mr Holmes a Court said AACo&apos;s herd was now a record 408,000 cattle due togood seasonal conditions and increased breeding productivity.
And the beef sold during the six-month period rose 14 per cent to 14 millionkg at $3.38/kg compared to $2.80 in the previous corresponding period, hesaid.
&quot;The global supply has been restricted by spiralling land costs and diseaseoutbreaks, but beef consumption continues to increase as the population andaffluence (of foreign countries) grow,&quot; Mr Holmes a Court said.
&quot;The US herd, the largest determinant of cattle prices, is at its lowestlevel for six years and young cattle prices are at their highest level in 14years.&quot;
Key upcoming projects include the &quot;de-commodification&quot; of beef by developingbranded beef through AACo&apos;s share of Melbourne&apos;s Polkinghorne&apos;s boutiquebutchery, and a joint tourism venture with R M Williams.

			<TEXT>TWO iconic Australian companies will expand into tourism, offering a &quot;true&quot;Outback experience to wealthy tourists.
Clothing maker RM Williams and cattle giant Australian Agricultural Companyexpect to take advantage of Australia&apos;s safe-haven status to lure the richto some of the harshest regions of the nation.
But wealthy travellers will not go without creature comforts.Timber-floored, air-conditioned &quot;tents&quot; will await them on their return fromday tours to cattle stations and aboriginal sites.
The tents will be moved about to suit seasonal changes throughout NSW,Queensland and the Northern Territory, on property owned by AACo.
The two companies will provide the initial administrative funding and staff,but will be seeking a suitable travel group to run the tours.
RM Williams chief executive Hamish Turner yesterday said the tours were adeliberate attempt to cash in on Australia&apos;s reputation after the Sydney2000 Olympics.
&quot;The positioning for Australia and the pictures sent to the rest of theworld could not have been bought,&quot; Mr Turner said.
Interest in Australia has been maintained through a large number ofdocumentaries and series shows, including the US &quot;Survivor - Outback&quot;reality television show.
For RM Williams, the tours represent an opportunity to benefit from itsoverseas stores acting as defacto Australian tourism offices for many years,Mr Turner claimed.
&quot;We act as a little bit of a visitors bureau for Australia in our overseasstores, answering questions about Australia and what its like ... and we seethis venture as a good way of developing the (RM Williams) brand.&quot;
Mr Turner said RM Williams currently made about 35 per cent of its domesticsales from tourists.
The joint venture company, to be known as Authentic Outback Tours, willpitch to the top few per cent of inbound tourists.
Of the one million tourists who visit the Australian outback each year, &quot;weare aiming at a small percentage, the first-class flyers and those coming onprivate charter groups,&quot; Mr Turner said.
&quot;It needs to be unique, pitched at the very top echelon of the internationalmarket and the top few per cent of the Australian domestic (tourism)market.&quot;
Mr Turner disagreed that it was a bad time to be starting a new tourismbusiness, despite massive falls in global tourism numbers since theSeptember 11 terrorist attacks on the US.
AACo&apos;s chief executive Peter Holmes a Court said the venture would be animportant opportunity to increase employment in the outlying areas in whichhis company operated.
&quot;The tours will significantly extend the options available for ecologicallysustainable tourism in outback Australia and will deliver the trueAustralian bush experience,&quot; Mr Holmes a Court said.
It is not the first deal between the companies. In November AACoshareholders were offered a discount on RM Williams clothing. Furtherco-operation is planned.
RM Williams shares last traded at $1.35 on January 24 and AACo was steadyyesterday at 92c.

			<TEXT>BUMPER beef prices will send the Australian Agricultural Company&apos;s profitssurging beyond its original forecasts.
Despite lingering fears of mad-cow disease in Japan, Sydney&apos;s AACo, owner ofthe world&apos;s second-biggest cattle herd, yesterday said it was on target to&quot;considerably exceed&quot; the $21.1 million profit it predicted last June.
AACo&apos;s shares jumped 5.7 per cent yesterday to close at 93c, up 5c.
A 5 per cent rise in the price AACo receives for cattle can add $12.8million to the company&apos;s earnings before interest and tax, AACo said in itsprospectus last year.

			<TEXT>BUMPER beef prices will send the Australian Agricultural Company&apos;s profitssurging beyond its original forecasts.
Despite lingering fears of mad-cow disease in Japan, Sydney&apos;s AACo, owner ofthe world&apos;s second-biggest cattle herd, yesterday said it was on target to&quot;considerably exceed&quot; the $21.1 million profit it predicted last June.
AACo&apos;s stock jumped 5.7 per cent to close at 93c, up 5c, on the improvedoutlook.
A 5 per cent rise in the price AACo receives for cattle can add $12.8million to the company&apos;s earnings before interest and tax, AACo said inprospectus last year.
AACo runs more than 400,000 cattle on 19 ranches spanning almost 1 per centof the nation&apos;s land mass.
The company said cattle prices strengthened in the December quarter, withthe benchmark Eastern States Young Cattle price averaging $3.50 a kilogram,up from $3.38 at the end of June.
Although cattle prices in 2001 were 30 per cent higher than in 2000,consumer concerns in Japan about mad-cow disease have seen cattle pricesfall by more than 10 per cent this month.
AACo chief financial officer Luisa Catanzaro yesterday acknowedged currenttrading conditions were being affected by a number of factors, including theoutbreak in Japan, which had caused cattle prices to retreat from the recordlevels of late 2001.
Japanese shoppers, who bought $1.7 billion of Australian beef last year,have been cutting their beef consumption after the discovery of three casesof mad cow disease since September.
&quot;However, the market remains in advance of prices achieved at the start ofthe financial year,&quot; she said.
&quot;The strong cattle price performance in the six months to December 2001,suggest that earnings for the full year to June 2002 are likely toconsiderably exceed prospectus forecasts.&quot;

			<TEXT>PETER Holmes a Court&apos;s Australian Agricultural Company and RM Williams yesterday announced a partnership with P&amp;O Australian Resorts to start a top class outback station resort in Queensland.   
Staying there won&apos;t be cheap, with prices about $800 a night.   
AACo and RM Williams formed a joint venture, The Authentic Outback Experience, in February last year to develop and operate high quality tours to outback Australia.   
The $4 million development with P&amp;O, to be built on AACo&apos;s 600,000 hectare property Wrotham Park, 300km west of Cairns, is expected to open next August, the companies said.   
A homestead and 10 guest quarters, set on the banks of the Mitchell River, will be owned and operated by P&amp;O Australian Resorts.   
AACo chief executive Peter Holmes a Court said the concept for a premium outback resort follows an extensive selection process and considered evaluation of a number of options.   
P&amp;O Australian Resort managing director Mark Campbell said there was rising interest in the outback as a holiday experience.   
&quot;Wrotham Park Station will position itself as a holiday experience that captures the heritage and spirit of outback Australia,&quot; he said.   
&quot;Capitalising on the strong demand both domestically and inbound for soft adventure tourism, Wrotham Park station will cater to a maximum of 20 guests at one time,&quot; he said.   
Wrotham Park Station would be offered as a complete resort experience with tariffs about $800 a person a night, which will include accommodation, meals, drinks and selected activities.

A homestead and 10 guest quarters will be set on the banks of the Mitchell River and will be owned and operated by P&amp;O Australian Resorts.   
Australian Agricultural Company chief executive Peter Holmes a Court said the concept for a premium outback resort was proposed late last year, and follows an extensive selection process and considered evaluation of a number of options.   
P&amp;O Australian Resort managing director Mark Campbell said there was an increasing amount of interest in the Australian outback as a holiday experience.

			<TEXT>THE $490 million sale of AMP Life&apos;s Stanbroke cattle station to a consortium of graziers and Swan Hill&apos;s Menegazzo family has been put on hold pending the outcome of an injunction application.   
Peter Holmes a Court&apos;s Australian Agricultural Company yesterday began a legal stoush with AMP Life and its manager AMP Henderson over the sale of Stanbroke Pastoral Co to Nebo Holdings.   
AACo sought an injunction in the Federal Court in Sydney to stop the sale from going ahead.   
Justice Michael Moore set down the interlocutory injunction hearing for Wednesday next week.   
Legal counsel for both sides agreed the hearing could be completed in one day.   
&quot;AMP Life and AMP Henderson have undertaken not to complete the sale before the afternoon of next Wednesday 24 September,&quot; an AMP spokesman said.   
&quot;Both AMP Life and the buyer, Nebo, were not expecting to complete before this time anyway. We&apos;ll be objecting to the AACo application for injunction vigorously.&quot;   
The transaction was due to be settled 30 days after the announcement of the sale on September 9.

			<TEXT>PETER Holmes a Court&apos;s Australian Agricultural Co and a raft of firms fromround the world are keen on the historic sale of AMP&apos;s Stanbroke PastoralCompany.
AMP Life is selling its 27 cattle stations, including 500,000 head ofcattle, in Australia&apos;s biggest ever land sale which may reap as much as $500million.
AACo managing director Don Mackay said yesterday the 179-year-old beefcompany had always said it wanted to have the capacity to run a lot ofcattle and produce a lot of beef.
&quot;But we don&apos;t necessarily have to own the cattle at the various stages oftheir life, nor the land.
&quot;Things can be managed differently,&quot; he said.
He did not know who would end up owning Stanbroke, or even if it would stayas one big parcel.
&quot;I don&apos;t know who will end up with Stanbroke or whether it will stay as awhole or whether it will be broken into little bits or a couple of big bits:there is a myriad of things that could occur.&quot;
He said Stanbroke was a business that had produced &quot;very satisfactory levelsof profits&quot; over its 40 year history.
&quot;It is a business that always generates very strong cash flow.&quot;

			<TEXT>GOURMET piemaker Shakespeares Pies has taken a bigger slice of the Australian market, announcing it will purchase WA&apos;s Jesters Jaffle Pies.  
The deal means Shakespeares will operate 61 gourmet pie shops across NSW, Victoria, Western Australia and New Zealand, making it Australia&apos;s largest franchise pie business.  
Jesters is being sold by cattle breeding operation Australian Agricultural Company, which will take 25 per cent of Shakespeares and gain board representation as part of the deal.  
Shakespeares chairman Neil Whittaker said the acquisition, the price of which has not been disclosed, was an exciting development which would benefit franchisees and their customers.  
&quot;We are delighted to have Jesters as part of the Shakespeares family and this purchase is a major step in our expansion program,&quot; he said.  
&quot;Shakespeares and Jesters have much to offer each other and franchisees will benefit from the strength and security of being in a larger organisation, which has a strong management focused on developing premium consumer food brands.&quot; Majority owned by investment company Hunter Bay Partners, Shakespeares has 15 New South Wales stores, with the number set to jump to 30 in the next 12 months.  
It was established in 1994 when Anthony Gualdi and his wife Beth opened the first store in Manly.  
The business teamed up with Hunter in 2003, opening seven outlets in the 2003-04 financial year.

			<TEXT>* ABOUT six months after his shock resignation as chief executive of the Australian Agricultural Company, Peter Holmes a Court is now cutting ties altogether by stepping off the board.   
Mr Holmes a Court has resigned as a non-executive director and offloaded a third of his shares, about $5.4 million worth.   
While it was widely reported when he gave up the ceo role that he was &quot;looking forward&quot; to staying on as a non-executive, Mr Holmes a Court assures Harbour it was only ever intended to be temporary.   
&quot;I stayed on to let the new management settle down and I&apos;m really happy with the new management. I think they are well and truly in the saddle now.&quot;   
Hacca II has not yet got another paid job -- he is currently a Mr Mum -- but says he is looking at it all, from entertainment to agriculture and even the internet industry.   
His job search included a recent two week trip to the US and UK with wife Divonne.   
But it wasn&apos;t all work and no play. Mr and Mrs Holmes a Court slipped in a visit to Los Angeles, where Divonne&apos;s cousin Andrew Jarecki, who introduced the pair, was up for an Oscar for his documentary Capturing the Friedmans. Needless to say, Oscar parties were enjoyed by all.   
* FINANCE institutions haven&apos;t had a good run of late.   
Scandal, sackings and police investigations have done little for their public image. But it seems some are making an effort to turn things around.   
The Members and Education Credit Union, or mecu, is offering cut rate car loans to people who buy environmentally friendly cars.   
Loans for the most fuel efficient cars have an interest rate of 7.24 per cent, with your untuned bellowing V24 revving out at 12.5 per cent.   
Furthermore, the credit union also plans to offset greenhouse gas emissions by planting 17 trees per car loan per year.   
Harbour spies tell us the credit union will also release a reduced rate home loan for the socially conscious, with reduced rates for solar power and other green friendly energy source.   
* Hope of maintaining all its operations have finally curdled for Italian dairy company Parmalat.   
The embattled company&apos;s administrator Enrico Bondi has a plan for the company to withdraw from 20 countries and and halve its workforce.   
However, its Australian operations will continue business as usual.   
The plans involves selling its US unit and operations in Latin America and Asia. The 32,000 strong workforce will shrink to just 17,000 as Parmalat concentrates its business in Europe, Australia and Canada.   
Bondi revealed the plan in his first meeting with Parmalat&apos;s creditors when he asked them to swap part of Parmalat&apos;s $16 billion debt into equity allowing the company to recapitalise and rejoin the stock exchange.   
* Spotted at Olympic swimming trials as guests of Telstra on Saturday night: former sports minister Michael Knight, Olympics official Sandy Holloway and swimming legends Dawn Fraser and Shane Gould.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIAN Agricultural Company lost $2.9 million in the first half, reflecting costs relating to the drought and a failed tender for Stanbroke&apos;s beef stations.   
However, AACo directors yesterday said the second half looked better and it remained on track to deliver full year earnings about 15-25 per cent above the 2002-03 result of $18.3 million, if price trends continued.   
The loss, which contrasted with a $3.8 million profit in the previous corresponding period, stemmed partly from the $2.5 million cost of the failed Stanbroke Pastoral Company tender and $900,000 for the exit of Polkinghomes butcher stores.   
The company failed to win a tender for cattle company Stanbroke Pastoral Co last year, with AMP Life selling Stanbroke to Nebo Holdings.   
The carry-over cost of the drought also had an impact on AACo in the first half, pushing up grain prices and sending feed consumption soaring, as well as increasing the need for supplementary grain and extra mustering.   
Feed costs in the half year rose to $246 per tonne, an increase of $84 from the previous period, while 68,000 tonnes of feed was consumed compared to 42,000 in the previous period, representing $7 million of extra cost.   
AACo chief executive Don Mackay said the extra costs were washing through the system.   
&quot;Really for us it&apos;s a tale of two halves,&quot; he said.   
&quot;We&apos;ve got a second half that&apos;s starting with significantly improved seasonal conditions, cattle prices that have improved, for the beginning at least, and just generally more robust market circumstances.&quot;   
Mr Mackay was appointed chief executive last month after the resignation of Peter Holmes a Court.   
The mad cow disease scare in the US prompted prices for Australian exports to Asia to rise, with AACo receiving increases of 10-12 per cent for grain-fed cattle.

			<TEXT>COMPETITION in the Japanese market and unsettled domestic cattle prices will wipe $10 million from Australian Agricultural Company&apos;s 2005 profit.   
Investors gave it a hiding, with its shares dropping 14.5c to $1.60.   
Managing director Don Mackay (pictured) also blamed new accounting rules, the lingering effects of the drought and rising fuel costs for the downgrade.

			<TEXT>BUOYED by recent rain in Queensland, cattle giant Australian Agricultural Company (AACo) says it is confident of paying a dividend again this year.  
AACo managing director Don Mackay said its Wylarah station -- one of AACo&apos;s two properties affected by the drought -- received 80 to 100mm of rain in the past week.  
&quot;We&apos;ll benefit greatly from that,&quot; he said.  
&quot;That rainfall in central and south Queensland is very valuable.&quot;  
Only two of AACo&apos;s 25 properties are drought affected.

			<TEXT>WOULD-BE George St cattle barons don&apos;t have to set foot in a paddock or saleyard to start their herd.  
They can now trade next year&apos;s T-bone the same way they trade shares in BHP or Rio Tinto -- on the internet.  
Modern technology like the internet and microchips means cattle owners don&apos;t have to be anywhere near a rural property.  
They can buy, sell and in the future potentially watch their investments being mustered online.  
Tim Scott and Charlie Frith from the backblocks of Queensland came up with the idea for Beef Stock Market after Mr Frith, a well-known cattle man, thought city folk would be interested in owning cattle.  
While there are other similar managed investment schemes available like Australian Agricultural Company subsidiary Rural Management Partners&apos;, Mr Scott said the difference with BSM was that city slickers could own individual cattle and keep track of them by using RFID (radio frequency identification devices) technology.  
And the scheme has proved a cash cow for investors, with returns in the 20 per cent range.  
The business partners believed making investors feel like they were part of the cattle industry was their market niche -- some visited their investments where they were agisted and even attended the cattle sales.  
And with things looking up in the local cattle industry as prices stay up after the drought and exports, in particular, expected to perform well, the pair have attracted investors.  
The BSM website describes the process as: &quot;You buy the stock, we fatten them for you and, if you wish, we sell them on your behalf.&quot; The investment is for about eight months while the cattle get to a weight at which they can be sold.  
The risks are not disimiliar to investing in futures markets but in this case traders are punting that, by the time the eight months has elapsed, cattle prices will be higher than when they bought them.

Gone are the days when top-grade beef was just traded across the butcher&apos;s counter. Today, retail billionaire Gerry Harvey produces a line of the most expensive wagyu beef and Greg Norman also has his own line. The golfer&apos;s Signature Wagyu is 350-day, grain-fed beef produced by the Australian Agricultural Company. There are two lines: signature and premium. His name is also attached to two further Australian lines: beef patties and hot dogs. They will all be flogged when Australia makes its annual big-sell into the US in early January. G&apos;Day USA: Australia Week 2007 will roll out a range of Aussie celebrities but at the pointy, business end, companies including Brookfarm muesli producers, the Valley Produce company, which makes truffle-infused honey, and King Island cheeses will hope to walk away with full order books.

			<TEXT>DESPITE the bad news afflicting the agricultural sector in recent weeks, with a worsening drought and continued water shortages, Don Mackay&apos;s Queensland-based Australian Agricultural Company (AAco) is trumpeting its successes.  
AAco released a clarifying statement to the stock exchange yesterday, saying that rather than struggling the company was actually thriving in 2006. AAco runs more than 560,000 head of cattle on 24 stations in Queensland and the Northern Territory, and better than average rainfall on many of the properties has resulted in a better than average season.  
&quot;Unlike the southern half of Australia the majority of AAco&apos;s properties are experiencing an above average season with ample supply of pasture and stock water,&quot; the company told the stock exchange.  
&quot;AAco&apos;s cattle are in excellent condition with weights of growing cattle above average.&quot;  
The statement was prompted by falling prices on the Eastern states Young Cattle Index from a Christmas 2005 price of about $3.65kg to below $3 yesterday, AAco chief financial officer Stephen Toms said.

			<TEXT>AGRIBUSINESS stocks are falling, unlike the rain.  
With no end to Australia&apos;s drought on the horizon, stocks that are linked to growing wheat or barley, grazing cattle, supplying fertiliser and agricultural chemicals, growing trees or olives, or even making grain-based bio-diesel fuel are being negatively affected -- or will be -- by the lack of water.  
Despite a stronger general share market yesterday, many agricultural stocks fell.  
Wheat exporter and farm products and services supplier AWB Ltd, which also faces the prospect of losing its wheat export monopoly as a result of the Iraqi kickbacks scandal, was 17c or 5.8 per cent lower at $2.78.  
Barley producer ABB Grain was down 13c at $6.39, grains marketer GrainCorp was off 35c at $7.31, diversified agribusiness Futuris Corp lost 4c to $1.88, agricultural chemicals firm  
Nufarm retreated 18c to $10, fertiliser supplier Incitec Pivot dropped 22c to $24.97 and cattle producer Australian Agricultural Co dipped 4.5c to $1.69.  
Grain producers have cut forecasts of receivals due to the drought, and Treasurer Peter Costello has warned Australia was facing a rural recession.  
The managing director of brokerage Lonsec, Norman Graham, said the brokerage&apos;s specialist agribusiness research arm believed the near future for many agricultural stocks was grim.  
&quot;The prospect for agricultural stocks is very gloomy, very gloomy,&quot; Mr Graham said.  
&quot;If you&apos;re looking at any multiple of earnings above 10 for this year, you&apos;re probably going to be disappointed. They are going to be hit hard.&quot;  
Mr Graham said wheat farmers were watching their crops wilt and starting to bale it as hay because there was no rain.  
Lower production of wheat and barley would not only affect grain companies.  
Companies such as AWB and Futuris that sell farm merchandise would suffer as farmers &quot;pulled their heads in&quot;.  
Cattle producers putting stock through grain feed lots to fatten them for market -- as well as pork and chicken producers -- would also face higher costs as grain prices rose.  
Higher wheat prices could affect the likes of breadmaker Goodman Fielder, and higher prices for barley could impact the margins of beermakers Foster&apos;s Group and Lion Nathan.  
&quot;The ramifications are fairly material all around the place,&quot; Mr Graham said.  
One of the few pluses arising from the drought was that the lack of water would probably result in a smaller grape harvest, which could help the troubled wine sector clear its glut of wine.  
&quot;So there&apos;s going to be some silver linings in the cloud, but not many,&quot; Mr Graham said.  
Aquacultural stocks were also likely to benefit as consumers switch from meat to fish.  
Mr Graham said meat prices for consumers may fall in the short term as drought-stricken graziers unloaded stock.  
However, in the first six months of next year, farmers who operate feed lots will probably be paying &quot;over-the-top&quot; prices for grain and will probably have de-stocked as much as they want to.  
Consequently, supermarket prices for meat are likely to rise.  
Mr Graham said the key to a turnaround in the agribusiness sector was widespread rain throughout Australia by mid-March next year.  
&quot;That will be the trigger for revisiting agricultural investments. In the next six months, you would not want to be there,&quot; he said.

			<TEXT>The world&apos;s largest beef producer, the sharemarket-listed Australian Agricultural Company, is spending $97 million to acquire two key Northern Territory properties from Janet Holmes a Court&apos;s Heytesbury group.   
Chairman Nick Burton Taylor yesterday told shareholders at the company&apos;s annual general meeting the group was buying the Anthony Lagoon and Eva Downs stations in the Barkly Tablelands area.   
The properties cover 936,000ha and carry 62,000 head of quality brahman and brahman-charolais cross cattle.   
&quot;This is an opportunity to acquire two outstanding stations with both breeding capacity and growing and fattening capabilities on their extensive lake systems,&quot; Mr Burton Taylor said.   
&quot;There is also significant potential for further development through the provision of additional water points and fencing.&quot;   
The chairman told shareholders the board intended to pay a similar dividend this year to 2005 but there would be zero franking credits this year.   
That was likely to continue as the company grew its herd, he added.   
AACo, which recorded a $16.8 million net profit for the 2005 calendar year, said it was expanding its portfolio through more expansion in the lucrative wagyu beef market.   
AACo plans to increase wagyu production from 8000 to 25,000 head per year annually in five years.   
Mr Burton Taylor added that while the company was not litigious, it was pushing ahead with court action over alleged damages involving the Stanbroke pastoral sale process.   
The matter is set down for February 19, 2007 and expected to last for about four weeks.   
AACo chief executive Don Mackay assured shareholders the global outlook for beef remained strong and the company was convinced the industry had a positive future.   
Turning to the outlook, he said the southern half of Queensland and much of NSW and Victoria remained very poor and this was affecting market conditions with higher cattle numbers pressuring prices.   
Mr Mackay also warned falls sustained past the end of June might affect inventory values and therefore reported earnings.   
He insisted that given the strong international demand for beef, current pressure on domestic prices would be quickly alleviated by lower supplies resulting from a break in the season in eastern Australia.   
He also praised the group&apos;s new Greg Norman-led wagyu marketing initiative in the US, saying it would pay dividends down the track.

			<TEXT>BURGEONING demand for marbled meat is driving major cattle businesses like the Australian Agricultural Company to deal with specialist producers of wagyu, the tastiest beef on the planet.  
Aaco, the biggest cattle producer in the world, moved  
into the premium end of the steak market yesterday, saying it would pay $1 million for  
the wagyu stud bulls owned by former Asian expatriate and now Palm Beach resident  
Chris Walker.  
The bulls form the centrepiece of Mr Walker&apos;s Westholme Wagyu Pty Ltd, which operates on a 1620ha property at Tarana, west of Lithgow.  
Aaco has also acquired an option to buy Westholme&apos;s complete cattle breeding business.  
Mr Walker, who spent 15 years in Japan, said he became interested in wagyu for one reason. &quot;Have you ever eaten it?&quot; the 66-year-old asked.  
He said he would now concentrate on breeding his wagyu bulls with angus cows to produce so-called F1 (first class) beef.  
&quot;There&apos;s infinitely less work involved in that business,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s a much less complex business model, which at my age is very appealing.&quot;  
Aaco announced it would purchase the total bull herd for about $1 million, with the option to acquire the balance of the assets for about $9 million.  
Managing director and chief executive Don MacKay said the acquisition was an opportunity for the company to deliver an improvement in its key assets in land, cattle, brands and people.

			<TEXT>BEEF producer Australian Agricultural Company Ltd says its full year results will benefit from a return of normal weather patterns and strong world demand for quality beef.   
However, the stronger Australian dollar and uncertainty over the price and volume of US beef going to the Korean and Japanese markets are likely to have a negative impact.   
Yesterday it reported a net profit for the first half of 2007 of $5.9 million -- down on the 2006 result of $8.5 million. That result was inflated by a one-off tax benefit of $6 million.

			<TEXT>CATTLE producer Australian Agricultural Company&apos;s bosses can&apos;t explain a surge in its share price on Tuesday.   
In a letter to the stock exchange, which queried the sudden jump, AACo said it was not aware of any reason for the big lift in the share price or the surge in the volume of its shares being traded.   
Volume halved as the rural chip&apos;s shares subsided 12c to $2.72 yesterday after the query.

			<TEXT>A GOOD wet season in northern Australia has put cattle producer  Australian Agricultural Co (AACo) on track for an improved performance this year.   
AACo managing director Don Mackay (pictured) said recent rain in parts of southern states also helped prospects.   
&quot;Our performance is expected to be a good deal better than last year -- that is the expectation of the market and we would at this point agree with that,&quot; he said after yesterday&apos;s annual meeting.   
In February, AACo said severe drought in the 2006 second half affected its markets, resulting in a calendar year net profit of $10.1 million, down from $16.78 million in 2005.   
Yesterday, Mr Mackay was upbeat about the outlook for the company&apos;s southern Australian cattle stations despite selling off beef cattle in the past few months.

			<TEXT>THE Australian Agricultural Company is on the verge of rivalling the great cattle breeding empire run by the late cattle king Sir Sydney Kidman at its peak in the early 1900s.  
The cattle company yesterday revealed it had built its herd by 11 per cent to 556,558 head on 22 stations across northern Australia last year.  
It is up from 502,866 cattle 12 months ago and nearing the peak herd of about 600,000 cattle run by the Kidman empire in the early 1900s.

			<TEXT>THE world is just not enough for James Packer.
As he invests billions in casinos in Macau and Las Vegas, the former media king is now believed to have his eye on a stake in one of Australia&apos;s biggest property and cattle companies.
Mr Packer&apos;s Consolidated Pastoral has emerged as a likely buyer of a 43 per cent stake in Australian Agricultural Company, which has almost 600,000 head of cattle.
It also owns a total of 8 million ha of land in the Northern Territory and Queensland, which is bigger than Ireland and equal to 1.2 per cent of Australia&apos;s land mass.
Shares in AACo surged in recent days on rumours a deal is imminent.
The firm would only say yesterday that the sale was in progress, without mentioning Mr Packer&apos;s name.
But analysts said Consolidated Pastoral had teamed up with another firm -- the Tipperary Group -- to be the likely frontrunner in the bidding war.
AACo&apos;s biggest property is the 1million ha Brunette Downs station in Northern Territory, which has 52 staff, 66,000 head of cattle and is run by manager Henry Burke.
``I live out bush, I don&apos;t know anything about that,&apos;&apos; he told The Daily Telegraph yesterday.
``We don&apos;t hear much about that sort of stuff at all.&apos;&apos;
When asked what he thought about Mr Packer possibly taking control of the property, he said: ``That would be nice, but at the end of the day it is business as usual for us.&apos;&apos;
On top of its property portfolio, AACo exports the much sought-after wagyu beef across the world.
AACo has linked with golf legend Greg Norman to sell its wagyu steaks to more than 400 US restaurants.
Mr Packer&apos;s land and cattle grab comes as he busily diversifies his portfolio through a number of family and investment companies.
Our second richest man -- behind resources entrepreneur Andrew Forrest -- is spending billions on casinos in Macau, Las Vegas and Canada.
Late last year he also paid almost $10billion for a stake in British water company Southern Water Capital.
Mr Packer has also been mentioned in recent weeks as a potential buyer of Extra, the UK&apos;s fourth biggest motorway&apos;s services chain at $850 million.
Extra owns fuel, food and accommodation services and would be Mr Packer&apos;s second purchase in the UK motorway industry.
His companies also have investments in television and magazines, websites, skincare products, fashion labels, ski resorts and resources.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIA&apos;S agriculture sector has remained immune to the volatility of the broader share market, with forecasters predicting a return of about 36 per cent over 2008.
According to the April Commonwealth Bank Agri Indicators Report, released yesterday, the agriculture sector has rewarded investors with a 37.5 per cent return in the past 12 months, dominating the -6.6 per cent return offered by the S&amp;P/ASX 200.
The report, which measures the performance of 16 rural-dependent companies, including Australian Agricultural Company, Gunns, and ABB Grain, suggests this trend will continue.
It forecasts agribusiness as the most attractive sector on a risk-return basis for 2008.
General manager for agribusiness at the Commonwealth Bank Jon Sutton said generous returns by thriving agribusiness stocks were set to continue.
``Forecast returns in the agri sector are expected to be around 36 per cent, compared to just 19 per cent across the wider market,&apos;&apos; Mr Sutton said.
He said the resilience of agribusiness had prompted interest from foreign investors.
``The strong performance of this sector and its resilience in a troubled market is being recognised by market players across the globe,&apos;&apos; he said.
There are several reasons behind the strong agribusiness story.
First, there&apos;s the rising world population. Currently at 6.6 billion, it is forecast to rise to eight billion in the next 12 years, a 21 per cent increase in the number of people to feed.
Then there&apos;s the global growth in income -- about three billion people&apos;s annual earnings have risen from about $US1000 a year to between $US5000 and $US6000 a year.
William Barbour, manager of the DWS Global Agribusiness Fund, said: ``As incomes increase, more of that money is spent on more food and, crucially, better quality food, such as meat instead of just rice or other cereals.&apos;&apos;
This has a big impact because, as meat production rises, cereal production must rise faster to provide animal feed. It requires 7kg of cereal to produce 1kg of beef, the same for pork.
The third key trend concerns the finite amount of farming land on the planet, with vast amounts eaten up by growing cities. More farmers are switching to producing corn and other cereals to produce ethanol for biofuel, which further cuts down on food production and pushes up food prices.
Finally, climate change is predicted to impact on the ability of farmers to grow crops, which will reduce supply further.
Amid this growing demand and falling supply picture, companies that can help increase crop yields and help with the production, transport and sales of food are well placed to benefit.
All this makes a compelling argument for the long-term growth in food prices, and supports further growth in the agribusiness sector.
Riccardo Briganti, head of research at Macquarie Private Wealth, said he believes food prices are breaking out of cyclical behaviour and will head upwards for some time.
``There have been some short-term supply and demand issues with the drought and weather conditions elsewhere in the world, but there&apos;s a bigger trend emerging here [with] higher demand, land shortages and biofuel issues all contributing,&apos;&apos; he said.
So it follows that there could be money to be made through investing in those companies that will increase crop yields from the available land and help bring about efficiencies in the food industry -- from farms to machinery to chemicals to transport and infrastructure.

			<TEXT>THE drought and the high value of the Australian dollar have pared the annual profit of  Australian Agricultural Company (AACo).   
But the beef producer and exporter says its performance has been sound in a tough market and the start to 2008 looks promising.   
AACo yesterday reported a net profit of $3.6million for calendar 2007, down 64 per cent on the prior year&apos;s profit of $10.10million.   
But the result was skewed by the inclusion in the 2006 result of a $6million tax benefit from the sale of AACo&apos;s Wrotham Park station in North Queensland. AACo shares closed down 7c at $2.98.

			<TEXT>THE cattle kings at Australian Agricultural Company Ltd have bolted on achain of Perth pie shops as it extends its &quot;paddock to plate&quot; strategy.
AACo executives looked at just about every pie operator in the country, andate a lot of pies, on their quest to find the right acquisition.
AACo has bought The Jesters Jaffle Pie Co, which has 31 owner-operatorfranchised stores in Western Australia and a licensed New Zealand store, forabout $2 million to $3 million in cash and equity.
From yesterday, Jesters&apos; 100 per cent beef pies would be made with AACobeef.
The purchase comprises two business units: a centralised cooking facilityand a retail franchising system.
Chief executive of the 178-year-old beef producer AACo, Peter Holmes aCourt, said the deal signed last night was expected to reap $10 million insales turnover in 2002-03.
Jesters receives royalty income as well as earnings from the supply ofcooked ingredients to the franchised stores.
&quot;The reality is we have the ability through Jesters to grow a significantproportion, 30 to 50 per cent, of our non-grilling cuts to enable us tovalue-add that meat at the highest percentage possible,&quot; he said.
&quot;These are low-fat high quality pies ... Jesters is all about healthier fastfood to compete against the existing fast food operators.
&quot;They have grown very quickly in the last three and a half years to becomeone of the fastest growing franchises in the country.
&quot;It is a good model and we want to expand it and get the same sort ofpenetration across the east coast.&quot;
AACo intends to roll out the first east coast Jesters store and pursueinternational licensing opportunities in 2003.
The latest deal creates a fully controlled supply chain that integratesAACo&apos;s genetic breeding with processing, preparation and distribution, usingMeat Services Australia&apos;s strict standards to sell to high-end restaurants,pubs and now pie shops.
AACo shares had firmed two cents to 94c yesterday.

			<TEXT>`The tours will deliver the true bush experience &apos; TWO Australiancompanies are expanding into tourism to provide a &quot;true&quot; outbackexperience to wealthy foreign tourists.
Clothing maker RM Williams and cattle giant Australian AgriculturalCompany expect to take advantage of Australia&apos;s safe haveninternational reputation to lure the richest of tourists to some of theharshest regions of the country.
But wealthy travellers to the expensive remote holidays will not gowithout creature comforts.
Timber-floored, air-conditioned &quot;tents&quot; will await those who ventureoutside for day tours to cattle stations and Aboriginal sites.
The tents will be moved about to suit seasonal changes throughout NewSouth Wales, Queensland and the Northern Territory, on property ownedby AACo.
The two companies will provide the initial administrative funding andstaff, but will be seeking a suitable travel group to run the tours.
RM Williams chief executive Hamish Turner said yesterday it was adeliberate attempt to cash in on Australia&apos;s fantastic post-Olympicsreputation.
&quot;The positioning for Australia and the pictures sent to the rest of theworld could not have been bought,&quot; Mr Turner said.
Interest in Australia has continued, with a large number ofdocumentaries and series shows, including the United States Survivor -Outback TV show.
For RM Williams, it would also be a great way to make money on thecompany being a defacto Australian tourism office through its foreignstores for many years, Mr Turner said.
&quot;We act as a little bit of a visitors bureau for Australia in ouroverseas stores, answering questions about Australia and what its like- and we see this venture as a good way of developing the [RM Williams]brand,&quot; he said.
Mr Turner said RM Williams made about 35 per cent of the company&apos;sdomestic sales from tourists.
The joint-venture company, to be known as Authentic Outback Tours, willpitch to the top few per cent of inbound tourists.
Of the one million tourists who visited the Australian outback eachyear, &quot;we are aiming at a small percentage, the first-class flyers andthose coming on private charter groups&quot;, Mr Turner said.
&quot;It needs to be unique, pitched at the very top echelon of theinternational market and the top few per cent of the Australiandomestic market.&quot; Mr Turner said he disagreed it was a bad time to bestarting a new tourism business, despite massive falls in globaltourism numbers since the September 11 terrorist attacks on the UnitedStates.
AACo chief executive Peter Holmes a Court said the venture would be animportant area to grow employment in the areas in which the company nowoperates.
&quot;The tours will significantly extend the options available forecologically sustainable tourism in outback Australia and will deliverthe true Australian bush experience,&quot; Mr Holmes a Court said.
It is not the first deal between the two companies. In November, AACoshareholders were offered a discount on RM Williams clothing, with moreplanned soon.

ABN AMRO Morgans adviser Yen Kow said interest in AMP spin-off HHG, which led to 7.6 per cent gains, was not spurred by any particular news.  
Gas bonus  
SHARES in junior resources explorer Innamincka Petroleum more than doubled yesterday, from 14c to 33c, after it revealed its Cooper Basin exploration struck gas.  
AACo boost  
SHARES in beef exporter Australian Agricultural Company Ltd (AACo) jumped nearly 5 per cent yesterday, in response to news the United States had reported its first case of mad cow disease.  
AACo shares finished 6c higher at $1.29.  
The rise was on top of a near 13 per cent increase after the case was first reported on Christmas Eve.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIAN bush-wear group RM Williams Holdings Ltd wants to export up to 40,000 pairs of its trademark boots a year to the United States within three years.  
RM Williams chief executive officer Hamish Turner also says there will be no change at the consumer end of the business when the company is officially privatised later this month.  
Chairman Ken Cowley launched a $26 million privatisation bid for the company in July through his companies, Strathig Pty Ltd and Strathig Holdings Pty Ltd.  
The $1.20-a-share offer has been well received by shareholders, with Strathig, now holding a 98.17 per cent stake of the company, in the final stages of completing the move.  
Mr Turner said yesterday the privatisation bid had progressed according to plan and there would be no difference for consumers once it was finished.  
He said management and staff would retain their jobs under the privatisation and he would continue as chief executive.  
RM Williams was in the final stages of negotiations with a major US retail chain on a deal which would significantly ramp up the group&apos;s exports, Mr Turner said.  
&quot;Exports generally to the US at the moment are at around 2500 to 5000 pairs of boots a year and the growth from that has really come from nowhere 18 months ago,&quot; he said.  
&quot;We are very encouraged by what has taken place over the past six to nine months in terms of the acceptance and the higher understanding of Australia generally across the US market.  
&quot;What we would like to think is that we will be in a position in three years&apos; time where we are exporting somewhere in the vicinity of 20,000 to 40,000 pairs a year.&quot;  
The boots sell for about $510 in the US and $330 in Australia.  
RM Williams now exports to the US, the UK, Germany, Switzerland, Japan, South Africa.  
Mr Turner said RM Williams preferred to link up with retail partners to distribute its products overseas.  
&quot;Exposure and distribution of your product is far better done by localised groups, rather than having our own stores,&quot; he said.  
Last month, the group recorded 2002-03 net profit of $479,000 and forecast improved profits this year.  
Mr Turner said trading in the first quarter of 2003-04 had been &quot;good&quot;.  
RM Williams has also struck a deal with Australian Agricultural Co Ltd to set up a camping resort near Cairns.

			<TEXT>Qantas appeal  
QANTAS has lodged an application for review with the Australian Competition Tribunal regarding its proposed $500 million tie-up with Air New Zealand. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission earlier this month determined to block the alliance, ruling the plan was anti-competitive and would lead to higher air fares for some passengers.  
Pay-TV deal  
TELSTRA has been given the go-ahead by the competition watchdog to bundle its services with pay-TV provider Austar United Communications Ltd. The decision handed down yesterday by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission means Telstra will be now be able to offer discounted Austar services to its retail residential customers.  
Newcrest aim  
NEWCREST Mining Ltd expects to more than double production levels at a lower cash cost within 12 months, the gold company&apos;s chairman Ian Johnson said yesterday. Newcrest posted a $92.2 million net profit to June 30, 2003, coming off a $53 million net loss in 2002.  
Pratt in films  
INDEPENDENT film and video distributor Magna Pacific Holdings Ltd plans to expand its market with help from new cornerstone investor, billionaire Richard Pratt&apos;s Thorney Holdings Pty Ltd. Thorney, the Pratt family&apos;s private equity company, will pay up to $10 million for a 15 per cent to 20 per cent stake in Magna in an agreement signed yesterday.  
Cattle boom  
THE Australian Agricultural Company Ltd said yesterday it was in a strong position to take advantage of an expected rise in cattle prices. The company posted a net profit of $18.3 million for 2002-03, down from $20.6 million in the previous year.

			<TEXT>THE Federal Court is expected to deliver its finding early next week on a bid to stop the sale of Stanbroke Pastoral Company to Nebo Holdings and Investments.  
Justice Ronald Sackville said he expected to hand down his decision on whether he will grant an injunction against the transfer at a sitting in Sydney on Tuesday afternoon.  
AMP Life sold Australia&apos;s largest landholder and cattle producer Stanbroke to Nebo, a consortium of wealthy rural families, earlier this month for $491 million.  
Peter Holmes a Court&apos;s Australian Agricultural Company Ltd (AACo) is seeking an injunction to stop the sale of Stanbroke to Nebo and have the tender process reopened.  
AACo alleges that AMP Henderson Private Capital&apos;s director of operations Marcus Derwin colluded with Stanbroke&apos;s Peter Hughes to get AMP Life to sell Stanbroke to Nebo for $491 million, even though AACo had offered $541 million.  
At yesterday&apos;s third day of hearings, Nebo barrister John Sheahan SC told the court it was wrong to think that Nebo had derived an advantage from the way the sale had taken place. &quot;Nebo might be a real loser . . . it might have paid a higher price than it needed to,&quot; he said.  
AACo barrister Douglas Meagher QC reiterated earlier comments that his client&apos;s $2.3 million tender had been a waste of time, since there had apparently been a separate entity clause -- favouring options where Stanbroke would not be split up -- which it did not know about.  
&quot;What matters is that it was a consideration,&quot; Mr Meagher said.  
&quot;My client did not know that this favourable consideration was being given.&quot;  
However AMP Life barrister Tom Bathurst QC said his client was under no obligation to disclose its selection criteria, with or without a separate entity clause.  
&quot;Even if it was the case . . . there was no obligation to disclose,&quot; he said.  
&quot;To maximise profit . . . is the aim of the process.&quot;  
Meanwhile, the Northern Territory government yesterday approved the transfer under the Pastoral Lands Act.  
It was required to make a decision because of the large area of land involved.

			<TEXT>AMP Life may have lied to the public about the reasons behind choosing the Nebo Holdings consortium as the successful bidder for its Stanbroke cattle empire.  
The Federal Court yesterday heard claims that there was an error in a press release from AMP Henderson, AMP&apos;s Life investment manager, on September 9 this year when it announced the $490 million sale to Nebo.  
Peter Holmes a Court&apos;s Australian Agricultural Company Ltd (AACo), which made a higher offer than Nebo, is seeking an injunction from the court to stop the sale being completed and have the tender process reopened. AACo&apos;s lawyers yesterday questioned AMP Henderson Private Capital director of operations Marcus Derwin about why he stated in the press release that one of the factors in choosing Nebo over rival bidders was because Nebo intended to keep Stanbroke as an &quot;ongoing concern&quot; and not break it up.  
The statement also appeared in an internal AMP document drawn up the day before the press release was issued to the media on September 9.  
Under intense cross-examination by AACo&apos;s barrister Douglas Meagher QC Mr Derwin gave a series of vague answers to questions about the accuracy of the statement and whether AMP had lied to the public and its policyholders.  
He eventually admitted the statement was &quot;factually incorrect&quot;, that &quot;price, price and price&quot; was the most important factor in determining the successful bidder and that the $50 million difference between AACo&apos;s offer and Nebo&apos;s bid was &quot;negligible&quot;.  
He also revealed that he had never told AACo that keeping Stanbroke as an ongoing concern would be a factor in determining who to sell Australia&apos;s biggest land holder and beef producer to.  
However on further examination by Justice Ronald Sackville Mr Derwin appeared to backtrack on his previous answers.  
Justice Sackville asked: &quot;Did I understand your previous answer correctly that you agreed that the statement was incorrect?&quot;  
Mr Derwin replied: &quot;If I did I have probably done so incorrectly. That statement should stand.&quot;  
Mr Derwin later told Mr Meagher that he meant to convey in the press release that the jobs of hundreds of Stanbroke&apos;s staff were safe even though Nebo had bought the business and the deal was &quot;a win&quot; for AMP. He denied that he was against Stanbroke merging with AACo, which had proposed such a deal as far back as March this year.  
Nebo is a consortium of five rural families in Queensland and the head of Hungry Jack&apos;s Jack Cowin.  
Earlier, lawyers for AMP and Nebo expressed outrage at allegations of collusion made. AACo had accused Mr Derwin of colluding with Stanbroke director and Nebo representative Peter Hughes to get AMP to sell Stanbroke to Nebo for a price less than AACo&apos;s offer.  
AMP Life&apos;s barrister Tom Bathurst QC yesterday argued that the allegations were serious and urged Justice Ronald Sackville to have them withdrawn.  
Nebo barrister John Sheahan SC said the allegations had &quot;absolutely no foundation&quot;.  
The case continues.

			<TEXT>AN AMP Henderson executive allegedly colluded with a Stanbroke Pastoral Company director to sell the cattle company to Nebo Holdings for a price less than a rival bid, a Sydney court was told yesterday.   
The allegations were raised in the Federal Court as Peter Holmes a Court&apos;s Australian Agricultural Company Ltd (AACo) began arguing for an injunction to stop Stanbroke being sold to Nebo, a consortium of wealthy rural families, and have the tender process reopened.   
AACo alleged that AMP Henderson Private Capital&apos;s director of operations Marcus Derwin colluded with Stanbroke&apos;s Peter Hughes to get AMP Life to sell Stanbroke to Nebo earlier this month for $490 million, even though AACo had offered $541 million.   
Mr Derwin was also a director of Stanbroke at the time while Mr Hughes was part of the Nebo consortium, headed by Hungry Jacks hamburger chain founder Jack Cowin and five rural families in Queensland.   
AACo&apos;s barrister Douglas Meagher QC alleged that Mr Derwin and Mr Hughes colluded after meeting on September 4 to discuss the sale.   
Five days later AMP Henderson, which manages AMP Life, announced that the cattle company had been sold to Nebo, despite AACo increasing its offer from $491 million to $501 million and finally $541 million. Mr Meagher claimed that after AACo increased its offer early on September 5 to about $500 million, Mr Derwin drafted a fresh offer document for Nebo to sign and submit to AMP Life.   
Nebo signed the document and sent it back to AMP Life around 7.30pm AEST, after Mr Derwin had left his office.   
Mr Meagher said Mr Derwin returned to the office around midnight and accepted Nebo&apos;s offer on behalf of AMP Life.   
&quot;We would say that what was happening at that stage was there was anxiety [to conclude the] sale to Nebo, lest my client come back with an even better offer again and if that is right . . . this wasn&apos;t advancing the interests of [AMP Life] policyholders,&quot; Mr Meagher said.   
&quot;This was ensuring Nebo would get the contract, notwithstanding [the higher the AACo offer].&quot;   
AMP Life has vowed to vigorously defend its decision to sell Stanbroke to Nebo.   
AMP Life&apos;s barrister Tom Bathurst QC said yesterday that AACo&apos;s court action was &quot;designed to frustrate&quot; the sale process because AACo &quot;didn&apos;t put its best foot forward during the tender process&quot;.   
He added that there was not a &quot;scintilla of evidence&quot; to support the claims made against Mr Derwin.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIA&apos;S second-largest beef producer said it would have no problem withimplementing a ban on land clearing in Queensland.
Australian Agricultural Company (AACo) chief executive Peter Holmes a Courtyesterday signed an agreement with the state to reduce tree clearing on its19 properties across Queensland.
AACo land covers 2 per cent of Queensland.
Mr Holmes a Court said the company was well able to support a tree-clearingban and environmental projects such as a halt to broadscale clearing ofnative trees and catchment management.
&quot;There are some areas where we could have had a more enlightened approachthan we have had in the past,&quot; Mr Holmes a Court said yesterday.
&quot;We are taking the position that we can do this as a company because theareas in which we operate are 98 per cent unimproved pastures.
&quot;With regards to our properties, it is the right thing to do in our areas.&quot;
AACo had not come &quot;cap in hand&quot; to the government but some other propertyowners may need significant transitional financing, he said.
Mr Holmes a Court denied there was any disagreement between AACo and peakagricultural group Agforce.
Larry Acton, president of Agforce, yesterday said Queensland farmers wouldgo along with a moratorium on land clearing applications until the end ofthe year.
But Mr Acton has rejected joint federal-state proposals to reduce treeclearing in the state, including bans on clearing woody vegetation beyond2006 and a compensation package. AACo yesterday also announced it wouldbegin negotiations with Aboriginal groups who have native title claims overthe company&apos;s pastoral properties. The move was welcomed by National NativeTitle Tribunal president Graeme Neate.

HOSPITALS operator Healthscope remains confident its $271 million takeover offer for pathology firm The Gribbles Group will succeed.

Revenue joy

China rates  
ASIAN financial markets showed little reaction yesterday to China&apos;s first interest rate rise in nine years, which analysts welcomed as a shift toward capitalist-style economic tools.  
China raised its benchmark one-year lending rate 0.27 per cent to 5.58 per cent.  
Budget flights  
SINGAPORE-based budget carrier Valuair will start flying daily to Perth, a popular Australian destination for Southeast Asian visitors, on December 1.

IRON ore developer Territory Iron roared onto the Australian Stock Exchange yesterday, beginning public life more than 80 per cent above its initial offer price. The stock debuted at 36.5c and peaked at 40c before ending its first day&apos;s trading at 36c.  
Dollar droops  
THE Australian dollar dropped sharply yesterday, running counter to expectations it would push through the US80c mark by the end of this week. Talk of a possible interest rate hike from China after inflation figures there sent the Aussie reeling to close at US78.98.  
Offer extended  
TOLLWAY operator Transurban Group has extended its $2 billion offer for the Hills Motorway Group by six days to March 24, saying it now has 16.52 per cent of Hills. Transurban had a 16.2 per cent interest in Hills when it made its offer in January.  
Shares option  
FONTERRA says its redeemable preference shares (RPS) option may be more beneficial than taking cash if National Foods Ltd shareholders approve the $1.9 billion takeover bid by New Zealand&apos;s largest company.

			<TEXT>AGRIBUSINESS stocks are falling, unlike the rain.  
With no end to Australia&apos;s drought on the horizon, stocks that are linked to growing wheat or barley, grazing cattle, supplying fertiliser and agricultural chemicals, growing trees or olives, or even making grain-based bio-diesel fuel are being hit, or will be, by the lack of water, say analysts.  
Wheat exporter and farm products and services supplier AWB Ltd, which also faces the prospect of losing its wheat export monopoly as a result of the Iraqi kickbacks scandal, was 17c lower at $2.78 yesterday.  
Barley producer ABB Grain was down 13cents at $6.39, grains marketer GrainCorp was off 35c at $7.31, diversified agribusiness Futuris lost 4c to $1.88, agricultural chemicals firm Nufarm retreated 18c to $10, fertiliser supplier Incitec Pivot dropped 22c to $24.97, and cattle producer Australian Agricultural Co dipped 4.5c to $1.69.  
Grain producers have slashed forecasts of receivals due to the drought, and federal Treasurer Peter Costello has warned of a rural recession.  
Lonsec brokerage managing director Norman Graham said the company&apos;s research arm believed the near future for many agricultural stocks was grim.  
&quot;If you&apos;re looking at any multiple of earnings above 10 for this year, you&apos;re probably going to be disappointed. They are going to be hit hard,&quot; Mr Graham said.  
Companies such as AWB and Futuris that sell farm merchandise would suffer as cash-poor farmers &quot;pulled their heads in&quot;.  
Higher prices for wheat could affect the likes of breadmaker Goodman Fielder, and higher prices for malting barley could impact the margins of beermakers Foster&apos;s Group and Lion Nathan.

			<TEXT>THE nation&apos;s biggest beef producer, Australian Agricultural Company, is looking to expand its presence in the luxury Wagyu beef market, despite difficult market conditions over the past six months.  
Wagyu beef is a high-fat, highly-marbled product beloved of gourmets.  
The breed of cattle from Japan is massaged, fed on beer and then its cuts are sold at huge prices in Tokyo.  
Wagyu meat has won over foodies in the US, with New Yorkers wolfing down Wagyu burgers at more than $US40 a pop.  
AAco&apos;s net profit rose 27 per cent to $8.47 million.  
&quot;We are intending to expand substantially our Wagyu beef production and our subsequent sale of Wagyu products for both Australia and our key export partners -- the United States, Japan, Korea and the balance of South-East Asia,&quot; the company said.  
The company did deals to buy Westholme Wagyu Herd for $10 million and Northern Territory cattle stations Eva Downs and Anthony Lagoon for $100 million, which included 60,000 head of cattle.

Rural Management Partners, a subsidiary of Brisbane-based Australian Agricultural Company, has been managing cattle projects for Environinvest, which was bought last year by Great Southern Plantations, since 2004.  
Great Southern will incorporate Wrotham Park and its 40,000 head into its cattle investment project which raised more than $70 million.  
The company snapped up Chudleigh Station near Townsville earlier this year.

			<TEXT>THE world&apos;s largest beef producer, the Brisbane-based Australian Agricultural Company, is spending $97 million to acquire two key properties in the Northern Territory from Janet Holmes a Court&apos;s Heytesbury group.  
Chairman Nick Burton Taylor told shareholders at the company&apos;s annual general meeting yesterday the group was acquiring the Anthony Lagoon and Eva Downs stations.  
He said both properties covered 936,000 hectares, or 2.3 million acres, carrying 62,000 head of quality brahman and brahman charolais cross cattle.  
&quot;This is an opportunity to acquire two outstanding stations with both breeding capacity and growing and fattening capabilities on their extensive lake systems,&quot; he told shareholders.  
Mr Burton Taylor said the board intended to pay a similar dividend this year to 2005 but there would be zero franking credits, and that was likely to continue in future years as the company grew its herd.  
AACo, which recorded a $16.8 million net profit for the 2005 calendar year, said it was expanding its portfolio through further growth in the lucrative Wagyu beef market.  
AACo had plans to increase Wagyu production from 8000 head a year to 25,000 head a year in five years.  
Mr Burton Taylor said while the company was not litigious, it was pushing ahead with its court action over alleged damages involving the Stanbroke pastoral sale process. The matter was set down for February 19 next year and was expected to last four weeks.  
AACo chief executive Don Mackay said the outlook for global beef remained strong and the company was convinced the industry had positive prospects for the future.  
Turning to the outlook, he said the southern half of Queensland and much of New South Wales and Victoria remained very poor and this was affecting market conditions with higher cattle numbers pressuring prices.  
Mr Mackay said these falls, if sustained past the end of June, might affect inventory values and therefore reported earnings.  
However, he said given the strong demand for beef internationally, current pressure on domestic prices would be quickly alleviated by lower supplies resulting from a break in the season in eastern Australia.  
He also praised the group&apos;s new Wagyu marketing imitative in the United States utilising Greg Norman, saying it would pay dividends down the track.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIA&apos;S biggest beef producer has bought the biggest full-blood herd of Wagyu cattle outside of Japan to triple its output of the premium beef.  
Brisbane-based Australian Agricultural Company yesterday paid $1 million to buy 133 bulls from Australian Wagyu pioneers, the Walker family from Tarana near Bathurst in NSW. It has the option of buying the rest of the Westholme Wagyu herd for $9 million later this year.  
Managing director Don Mackay said the company was aiming to have 25,000 head of Wagyu cattle from the 8000 it now markets.  
&quot;Most of it goes overseas but it&apos;s become much more common in restaurant menus in Australia,&quot; he said.

			<TEXT>AGRIBUSINESS Futuris plans to sell its 43 per cent stake in beef producer Australian Agricultural Company, as it focuses on its forestry and telecommunications operations.   
Futuris also said yesterday it was on track to meet market expectations of underlying earnings between $95 million to $113 million for 2007-08.   
Chief executive Les Wozniczka said the group wanted to grow its forestry and telecommunications operations and get more out of its Elders rural services and finance network.   
``As a result, directors have concluded that it is opportune for Futuris to realise the value that has been built through its investment in, and corporate support for, Australian Agricultural Company,&apos;&apos; he told shareholders at the company&apos;s annual general meeting in Melbourne.   
AACo stock soared 12 per cent, or 30c, to $2.80.   
The company has a market value of about $718 million, a herd size of 631,000 and ownership of more than 7.9 million hectares of prime pastoral property.   
Mr Wozniczka said the stake, worth about $309 million based on yesterday&apos;s share trading, was a ``wonderful asset&apos;&apos; but equity markets were yet to adequately recognise its value in Futuris&apos; share price.   
``As a result, the directors consider that shareholder value considerations recommend the sale of the shareholding to capture the unrecognised value and enable reinvestment of proceeds within our existing operations, where greater shareholder value can be achieved,&apos;&apos; he said.   
Futuris said it had commissioned Citigroup and Caliburn to conduct a global sale process of AACo within the current financial year.   
AACo said it was in talks with Futuris about to the planned sale.   
Futuris also said despite the drought continuing to impact its operations, the company&apos;s key businesses were performing strongly.   
Futuris booked a net profit of $100.7 million for 2006-07, with the group&apos;s forestry operations making the largest earnings contribution.   
Futuris shares rose 11.5c to $2.10 yesterday.

			<TEXT>BEEF rather than live cattle will increasingly provide the profits for the nation&apos;s largest cattle business, the  Australian Agricultural Company.
The success of its beef strategy was told at the company&apos;s AGM yesterday -- with an 86 per cent increase in branded beef sales to $74 million last year.   
The dramatic increase from $39.9 million the previous year has the company poised to earn more from beef sales than cattle in future.   
AACo chief executive Don Mackay said the aim was to market 40 per cent of its total production through its branded beef operations.   
Mr Mackay said its growing branded beef marketing program allowed it to share in the margin throughout the beef supply chain, to deliver higher returns.   
Its branded beef program is based on beef sales through the 100 per cent owned Chefs Partner, the 1824 beef brand and Wagyu beef sales.   
Mr Mackay said the 1824 brand had been introduced in Japan last October.   
&quot;Another significant step in the development of the 1824 brand is its recent introduction on a trial basis into 50 Woolworths stores in northern New South Wales and Queensland,&quot; he said.   
Mr Mackay said AACo&apos;s processing capacity for 1824 branded beef had increased from 250 to 550 cattle a week, contributing significantly to its branded sales last year.   
Its goal was to increase capacity to 700 head a week by the end of 2007, requiring the development of new export markets in Asia, the United States, Dubai and Singapore.   
He said AACo was also working to establish stronger markets for Wagyu beef, as it owned the largest Wagyu herd in Australia and expected to market the beef from about 15,000 cattle.   
Mr Mackay said the drought had forced it to write down its cattle herd valuation by $17.3 million, leading to a 40 per cent fall in full-year profit to $10.1 million.   
Its shares closed down 4c to $2.56 yesterday.

			<TEXT>THE Australian stockmarket rallied yesterday to hit record highs after a weak start, with agricultural stocks some of the better performers on a mixed day&apos;s trading.  
The all ordinaries gained 10.1 points to hit 5714.1.  
Austock Brokers senior adviser Michael Heffernan said a weak lead from Wall St dragged the market down early but it rallied late to hit new highs.  
&quot;The market finished with great gusto after being down this morning,&quot; Mr Heffernan said. The CommSec Agstocks index, an index of nine rural-dependent companies, hit a three-year record high yesterday of 138.2 points, on hopes for an easing of drought conditions.  
Included in the index is Australian Agricultural Company, ABB Grain, AWB, Futuris, GrainCorp and Queensland Cotton.  
ABB Grain added 43c to close at $7.49, AWB lost 1c to $3.40 and Graincorp added 10c to $10.00.  
The big miners were mixed despite commodity price gains overnight, with Rio Tinto adding 69c to $73.61 and rival BHP Billiton shedding 5c to $25.28. Engineering group Downer EDI shed 5c to $6.77. A group of shareholders is suing the group over the guidance it gave on the delayed Douglas mineral sands project in Victoria.  
In the banking sector, Westpac gained 31c to $24.91, ANZ added 11c to $28.70, NAB lost 22c to $40.47 and Commonwealth shed 15c to $49.95.  
In media, PBL gained 25c to $20.35, Fairfax edged 3c higher to $4.86, News Corp slipped 12c to $30.40 and its non-voting shares picked up 5c to $28.99.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIA&apos;s largest beef producer, Australian Agricultural Co Ltd (AAco), says the outlook for the beef market is strengthening.
AAco also said yesterday it had acquired a Wagyu stud herd for about $1 million.
AAco said that over the past month cattle market conditions had continued to improve, with beef prices remaining high, a softer exchange rate for the Australian dollar, and falls in oil prices and interest rates.
Chief executive Stephen Toms said beef prices were still at 18 month-highs of 360 cents per kilogram.
Export receipts had benefited from the steep decline in the Australian and US dollar exchange rate to about 80 US cents, from 98 US cents in July.
``The decline will boost Australian dollar receipts, particularly on sales into the USA over the next 12 months,&apos;&apos; he said.
``Upward pressure on beef prices is expected to be sustained by the continued shortfall in supply globally with breeding herds in China, Russia and the US either in decline or flat and evidence that the growth in Brazilian beef exports has peaked.&apos;&apos;
Recent rainfalls across central Queensland had encouraged graziers to restock to make good use of feed pools, Mr Toms said.
``The three-month outlook shows an even chance of seasonal rains on AACo&apos;s northern stations and an even better outlook for those in south-east Queensland,&apos;&apos; Mr Toms said.
AACo&apos;s purchase of the Innisfail-based 4JS herd, increases its Wagyu production capacity by 50 per cent.
The 850-head herd, which is currently in North Queensland, will be re-located to AACo&apos;s Surat property, Wylarah, in southern Queensland, where the primary focus is Wagyu.

			<TEXT>BEEF cattle giant Australian Agricultural Co felt the pinch of higher fuel, labour and feed costs in the half year to June 30 and reported a bottom line net loss of $2.2 million.
But new chief executive Stephen Toms yesterday said AACo&apos;s operating cash flow for the six months was $5.9 million, compared with a negative cash flow of $20 million a year earlier.
He said AACo was expecting ``a rapid increase in cattle prices in the remainder of the year&apos;&apos;.
This all left investors unimpressed, with AACo shares, which touched $3.18 during the day, ending almost flat at $3.01.

			<TEXT>Tassie defiant
HIGHER interest rates and rising fuel costs put a brake on vehicle sales in April. They dropped to a six-month low.
New motor vehicle sales across Australia fell by 0.8 per cent in the month, seasonally adjusted, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said to 89,255 units .
However, Tasmania had a solid rise in car sales for April, 6.4 per cent, the highest of any state.
Funtastic up
A $132 million private equity offer has put some life back into Funtastic&apos;s stock, which had hit the doldrums. Funtastic shares surged 31.78 per cent, or 17c, to close at 70.5c after the Archer-led offer was announced.
AACo stoush
AUSTRALIAN Agricultural Company chairman Nick Burton Taylor has been dumped from the position, after a major shareholder opposed his re-election at the beef producer&apos;s annual general meeting yesterday. Futuris, which holds 43 per cent of AACo shares, opposed Mr Taylor&apos;s re-election.

			<TEXT>FUTURIS is keeping cattle producer Australian Agricultural Co on its menu -- yesterday abandoning plans to sell a 43 per cent stake.
The company, whose interests span beef, horticulture, forestry, financial services and telecommunications, said it had received proposals but none which ``offered certainty&apos;&apos; in terms of timing and execution. It had planned to sell its stake in Brisbane-based cattle producer AACo by the end of this June and media reports had put James Packer&apos;s Consolidated Pastoral as among the frontrunners to buy its shareholding.
AACo owns about eight million hectares of land across Queensland and the Northern Territory, with about 600,000 head of cattle.

			<TEXT>THE world is not enough for James Packer.
As he invests billions in casinos in Macau and Las Vegas, the former media king is now believed to have his eyes on a stake in one of Australia&apos;s biggest property and cattle companies.
Mr Packer&apos;s Consolidated Pastoral has emerged as a likely buyer of a 43 per cent stake in Australian Agricultural Company, which has almost 600,000 head of cattle.
It also owns a total of eight million hectares of land across the Northern Territory and Queensland, which is bigger than Ireland and equal to 1.2 per cent of Australia&apos;s land mass.
Shares in AACo have surged in recent days on rumours a deal is imminent, although the company yesterday would only say the sale was in progress, without mentioning Mr Packer&apos;s name.
But analysts say Consolidated Pastoral has teamed up with another firm, Tipperary Group, to be the likely front-runner in the bidding war.
On top of its property portfolio, AACo exports the much sought-after Wagyu beef across the world.
The company has even teamed up with golf legend Greg Norman to sell its tender Wagyu steaks to more than 400 restaurants in the US.
Mr Packer&apos;s land and cattle grab comes as he busily diversifies his portfolio.

			<TEXT>This is a story of how a Gippsland cattle farmer recently cametogether with a scion of one of the richest families in Australia toform a partnership that could potentially change the way Australiansshop for beef.
It&apos;s about Rod Polkinghorne, a farmer with some strong ideas about howbeef should be marketed, and multi-millionaire Peter Holmes a Court, sonof Janet. Mr  Polkinghorne has developed an innovative beef-gradingsystem that he has been testing at a butcher shop in Albert Park, whileMr Holmes a Court runs the listed company Australian AgriculturalCompany (AACo), one of Australia&apos;s largest beef operations.
AACo was spun out of Futuris Corp in July - Futuris retains 40 percent. Futuris is, in turn, run by Alan Newman, the former right-hand manof the late Robert Holmes a Court, Peter&apos;s father and Janet&apos;s husband.Oxford-educated, Peter Holmes a Court is AACo&apos;s chief executive and amajor shareholder, but only  recently returned to Australia after 16years overseas.
Before his return, Mr Holmes a Court worked as a financial analystwith James  D. Wolfensohn Inc, an investment bank in New York. Despitethe family backing - he reportedly sold out of the Holmes a Courtfamily company Heytesbury for $35 million in 2000 - he is also amillionaire in his own right, having formed international entertainmentgroup Back Row Productions in 1993. Back Row took the Australian showTap Dogs around the world and also toured comedians such as Eddie Izzardand Jerry Seinfeld. Mr Holmes a Court sold that business for $5millionthe same day he sold his stake in the family concern.
Mr Polkinghorne has been a Gippsland farmer for more than 30 years,but the seed for his innovative beef-grading system was planted when hewent on a study tour of the United States in 1970.
On the surface, it&apos;s an unlikely pairing. But since they got togethera couple of months ago, they have embarked on a plan that could see thename Polkinghorne&apos;s developed into a network of company-owned orfranchised stores similar to the main street bakery chain Brumby&apos;s.
The story really began to take shape a little over a year ago when,after 30 years breeding and raising the best beef he possibly could, MrPolkinghorne became frustrated. No matter what effort he put intoensuring the quality of his  cattle, once they left the farm gate he hadlittle control over how they would be served up to the consumer.
The separation between cattle farmers and consumers had served bothpoorly, he said. Farmers were robbed of control over the use of theirproduce and consumers had to buy meat without knowing where it camefrom, how it had been processed or how it could best be used.
``We have got a national and international industry where meat couldbe coming in a box from anywhere,&apos;&apos; he said. ``There has not been a way(for the consumer) of knowing its quality.&apos;&apos;
For Mr Polkinghorne this was wrong. He is passionate about the need tomake buying beef simple. ``A lot of people think beef is difficult tocook, and it has got to the point where they are scared to buy it,&apos;&apos; hesaid. ``But the truth  is they shouldn&apos;t be able to buy a bad beefmeal.&apos;&apos;
Such was his zeal that in late 2000, Mr Polkinghorne decided to bypassthe meat processing and distribution industry and start selling hisbeef direct to the public.
In partnership with Judy Philpott, he bought a butcher shop in AlbertPark and opened for business in April, 2001. It was a big step for afarmer from Gippsland, but a move that had its roots in the year-longstudy tour. It was on this trip that he developed an interest in meatgrading, and when he returned home he started applying US meatproduction methods to his cattle.
Then, seven years ago, he began researching consumer tastes in beef.Mr Polkinghorne found that, though little could be told about a pieceof beef from its appearance, consumer tastes were remarkably consistent.There was general agreement about which cut tasted good and which didnot.
``That meant there was real prospects in terms of branding, but italso meant  you couldn&apos;t cheat,&apos;&apos; he said.
Using the research results, he developed a model to grade beefaccording to key data about each animal, including its breeding stock,age, any illnesses or ailments it had suffered, how it was slaughtered,which muscle is used and how it was processed.
But, rather than presenting consumers with a bewildering array ofinformation  about meat, Mr Polkinghorne&apos;s idea was to use the gradingsystem at the processing stage, presenting customers with a simple rangeof high-quality, pre-prepared cuts and complete meals.
``We have made it as easy as possible to buy and to cook meat,&apos;&apos; hesaid. ``People shouldn&apos;t have to know all about meat. What they want isthe best cut for whatever it is they are having - a steak, a roast orstir-fry.&apos;&apos;
He took his system to the meat industry but was met with blank looksand indifference. ``So, in a rush of blood, we bought a butchery inAlbert Park. We thought it should be done, even though we had no greatdream of being a retailer.&apos;&apos;
Since April, he has been selling beef from his 1200-head farm to anincreasingly enthusiastic public. They may have had little experience inretailing, but Mr Polkinghorne and Ms Philpott were shrewd in theirchoice of location and approach to customers.
Mr Polkinghorne said their products, including not only pre-preparedmeat cuts but also meals complete with vegetables and sauces, werepopular with local  residents who were too busy to spend much timepreparing and cooking meals.
He said customers were encouraged to feel the shop was their shop andto visit his Gippsland farm. ``It&apos;s been a wild ride, but verysatisfying at the customer level.&apos;&apos;
The success of the shop was such that in late November Mr Holmes aCourt&apos;s AACo bought the business. Mr Holmes a Court said the purchasegave AACo access to a working beef-grading system and a brand name.Under his vision, Polkinghorne&apos;s could be developed into a network ofcompany-owned or franchised stores.
AACo is one of Australia&apos;s oldest companies, has more than 400,000cattle on 18 stations in Queensland and the Northern Territory and itsstations cover 65,000 square kilometres - around 1 per cent of thecountry. Under the deal, a new company was formed, with AACo buying 51per cent for $750,000 and Mr Polkinghorne and Ms Philpott owning therest.
Mr Polkinghorne said he was comfortable with the arrangement, sayingthere was a ``really good fit&apos;&apos; between the two. ``AACo is there withthe same vision,  and it has got the resources. Their interest is towork with their produce, like ourselves,&apos;&apos; he said.
For AACo&apos;s part, the deal is part of Mr Holmes a Court&apos;s drive tobring more vertical integration into what is Australia&apos;s second-largestbeef business. Only  time will tell if this unlikely pair can pull itoff.

			<TEXT>It&apos;s more than twice the size of Luxembourg and it can be all yours. DONNA COUTTS visits Wrotham Park station  
THERE is debate among the four guests as to which countries are smaller than Wrotham Park. It&apos;s not that we lack the technology to look on the internet.  
It&apos;s just that the leather lounges are too comfortable, the drinks too forthcoming and the air too cool in the bar for any of us to tear ourselves away.  
Apart from 14 resort staff tending to every whim and 23 station staff, we have this Outback Queensland cattle station to ourselves. And it&apos;s not as though we can see any of the boundary fences.  
So how big is it? In the Australian Agricultural Company&apos;s pastoral empire - which accounts for about 1 per cent of Australia - it&apos;s a modest patch of dirt. But it covers 600,000ha or 6000sq km. By comparison, Luxembourg is only 258,600ha. Wrotham Park is midway between Cairns and the Gulf of Carpentaria, on grazing land technically called Gulf savannah. AACo runs Brahman cattle here, most of them eventually bound for markets in the Middle East.  
The station is now open as a resort, a joint venture between AACo, leather-boot icon R.M. Williams and Voyages Resorts.  
The Wrotham resort is a luxury oasis for a maximum of 20 guests. A stay at the resort is a cleverly orchestrated Outback experience, with station life on show. But the guests are insulated from discomfort with airconditioning, heaps of beautiful food and wine and tasteful interior design.  
The cabins are metres from the edge of the cliff that forms the bank of the Mitchell River.  
Inside, they are decked out in earthy furnishings. Apart from sleeping and the time you choose to spend chilling out on your private veranda, it&apos;s the resort &quot;homestead&quot; that&apos;s the focus.  
So how to fill a stay with more than cold drinks and airconditioned comfort? With ease. We take a guided nature walk, slowly, when the heat has gone from the day.  
From the homestead, we clamber down the cliff face into the gorge and see stunning earth formations, birds, wallabies, lizards and butterflies.  
Then there is a station tour in new Landcruisers, where you see majestic cranes, dozens of wedge-tailed eagles - and herds of Brahman cattle grazing.  
Back on the lawn of the homestead we have a picnic lunch - baguettes stuffed with ham and brie followed by giant, cold mangoes.  
Then there is the pool where you can take a dip - after staff have removed the cane toads!  
The Lowdown  
GETTING THERE: The resort is 300km by air west of Cairns.  
WHEN TO GO: The resort closes for the wet season in December. It reopens April 1.  
DETAILS: See voyages.com.au or aaco.com.au for Wrotham Park Resort. Accommodation in 10 double airconditioned cabins is $800 a person a night, twin-share. Sole occupancy is $1050.  
Did you know? Wrotham Park Station runs 35,000 head of Brahman cattle

			<TEXT>A quick hit of what&apos;s  
hot and what&apos;s not  
Breeding confusion  
WAGYU. Now there&apos;s a word we&apos;ve been hearing a lot lately - although nobody seems to be sure what it actually means. According to the Australian Agricultural Company&apos;s Pete Cabassi, the term is widely misunderstood to mean a brand of beef when, in fact, it refers to a breed of cattle. &quot;Wa&quot; means Japan, &quot;gyu&quot; means cattle. &quot;Local diners have quickly gained a taste and an awareness of wagyu beef but unfortunately there is still a widespread perception amongst them, and most chefs, that Wagyu is a beef brand, rather than a breed, and that all Wagyu steak will taste the same,&quot; says Cabassi, whose Darling Downs Wagyu is available at venues including the Breakfast Creek Hotel. He says discerning diners should be aware of the brand of the Wagyu they are eating, the cut being offered and the amount of marbling in it (rib eye and sirloin are more tender and more marbled cuts, while rump is less marbled and &quot;has a more robust level of tenderness&quot;), and how the Wagyu is to be cooked and served.  
Rocking the bar  
THE Bar Secrets Australian collection has expanded from playing-card packs featuring hotspots in Australia&apos;s major cities, including Brisbane, to a CD. Secret Sounds: Soundtrack to the Bars of a Nation features 15 new tracks and remixes by the likes of Mr Jigga, Mac Project, DJ DOnni 1, Simon Grey, Crazy Penis and Butch Le Butch.

Get in the frame  
Seems the fatter your frame (sunglasses, that is) the more hot you will be right now.  
Expensive designer frames continue to take off, but, at the rate I misplace sunglasses, I wish they weren&apos;t as pricey. Anyway, the latest shades from names like Gucci, Burberry (pictured), Christian Dior (these are huge), Armani, Diesel and Ralph Lauren have just landed on our shores via importer Safilo.  
Loving Dior&apos;s mega-huge styles (sported by Mrs Becks) or the latest Gucci (favoured by Paris Hilton).  
Trends to look for are bits of bling, oversized frames, rhinestone detail, metal-wraps and the chunkier Jackie O frames.  
They are available from Myer, David Jones, and selected boutiques and optometrists.  
Sporty and fit for travelling  
Following the pretty and very Australian vibe that has hit this season&apos;s fashion racks is established label Sportscraft.  
The Sportscraft women&apos;s collection has been inspired by travel, with Africa the most important influence.  
Prints and patterns seem to be everywhere, as well as key wooden and glass accessories.  
Sportscraft (owned by the Apparel Group, which has just taken over Saba and has manufacturing deals with Morrissey and Marcs) is one label that seems to be thriving in the current fashion retail market.  
As the season progresses, expect to see sophisticated bohemian looks, cuffed wide-leg pants, longer silhouettes that are wafty and sheer, rich colours like tangerine, henna and green tea, and a big dose of teal blue that will be a hit shade for the season ahead.  
Available from Sportscraft stores.

Party of the decade  
It&apos;s pretty much a milestone these days to last 10 years doing anything and, because marie claire mag has made it that far, they&apos;re doing some serious partying at the Australian Technology Park on Tuesday night.  
Here&apos;s a sneak peek of the latest issue, featuring Hilary Swank who, for the first time on an Aussie front cover, has a silver foil masthead with her silver dress covered in glitter.  
Organisers promise this will not be &quot;your stock-standard, predictable celebration&quot;.  
&quot;This is a party, time to let our hair down,&quot; says editor of 10 years Jackie Frank.  
For the first hour, guests will be in a holding room sipping Bollinger, while viewing 10 years of marie claire visuals before Jackie Frank (who just took out the mag editor of the year award) mc&apos;s international executive Laurence Hembert welcome guests.  
The vibe will be a winter wonderland, with open bars, DJs Ajax &amp; Steve Ferris, performance acts, and, yes, it is a David Grant special event.  
Glamour guests will include Alex Perry, Akira, Dan Single, Sarah-Jane Clarke, Kate Fischer, Skye Leckiem, Laura Csortan, Tracey Spicer, Tahyna Tozzi and Deni Hines.  
Casting a spell  
Doesn&apos;t this gorgeous picture kind of get you in the mood for a new season? Looking all floppy and warm and fresh and sun-kissed, it&apos;s the vibe that Witchery has pursued for the new season.  
Strapless dresses, denim cropped pants, lace camisoles, shorts, anything in white, jewelled flats, embellished kaftans and gypsy skirts are just some of the pieces you&apos;ll find in store.  
Witchery has gone big into accessory land too with soft textured leather boho bags, wedged espradrilles and wooden stacked and corked heels. Yummo.  
Witchery has also just opened new, bamboo, leather and suede accessorised concept stores throughout Australia -- but they are yet to reach Sydney yet.  
Good  
The well-seasoned walk of model Alyssa Sutherland (right) worked beautifully at the Myer show; a happy 70th to Lawsy who&apos;ll celebrate in fine style tomorrow night; Arida on Macleay Street Potts Point has just started a sale; great food at The Oyster Shell in Beverly Hills (Sydney, not LA!)  
Bad  
Oh no, let&apos;s hope that poor Glenn McGrath&apos;s nasty ankle accident doesn&apos;t ruin our chances in the Ashes Test series against England; the poor old croc who, at 17, died of lung disease at Taronga Zoo; let&apos;s not even go there about ridiculous petrol prices.  
Loving It  
Four Wallabies will model at Westfield Chatswood on Thursday, just two days before the Bledisloe Cup -- they&apos;ll be launching the Canterbury CCC line of sportswear; one of the best of Nine&apos;s This Is Your Life show was on the Easybeats&apos; terrific lead singer Stevie Wright (left).  
Over It  
The ever-increasing number of poker machines being installed in pubs and, now, upmarket bars -- some rich publicans obviously haven&apos;t seen the damage they can do to families and their finances; the matching tattoos the Kabbalah-supporting Beckhams (David, left) have adopted.

			<TEXT>HEAVY rain in rural Australia has rewarded investors in several agriculture-related stocks.  
Orica, Nufarm, ABB Grain, Australian Agricultural Company and AWB have posted healthy gains since early May.  
Orica&apos;s share price has risen 18.5 per cent since May 6. Nufarm is up 16.9 per cent, ABB Grain has put on 17.8 per cent, Australian Agricultural Company is up 25.9 per cent and AWB is up 12.5 per cent.  
Rain in the past month has removed the threat of farmers being unable to plant winter crops in eastern Australia, according to analysts.  
Scott Marshall, of Shaw Stockbroking, says farmers were within two weeks of missing the planting season.  
&quot;Before the rains, there just wasn&apos;t enough moisture for the grain to germinate,&quot; he says.  
Marshall says investors jumped on agriculture-related stocks as soon as it became clear farmers would be able to plant crops.  
He says Orica&apos;s share price rose largely in response to an expected increase in the demand for fertiliser.  
Demand for chemicals to protect crops pushed up Nufarm&apos;s share price.  
An improved outlook for wheat production has been reflected in AWB&apos;s higher share price, Marshall says.  
&quot;Not only do I expect the share prices to be sustained, but I can see an upside.  
&quot;We&apos;re talking about efficient, well-managed companies. The risk is that agricultural businesses are at the mercy of the weather.&quot;  
Stefan Whiting, of ABN Amro Morgans, says the rain has helped beef producer Australian Agricultural because a greater  
supply of feed barley will bring down prices.  
Whiting says ABB Grain will store, process, market and trade more grain as a result of favourable weather conditions.  
&quot;Rain is the equivalent of pennies from heaven for those working or investing in the agricultural industry,&quot; he says.  
Marshall says investors can expect considerable volatility from agricultural stocks.  
&quot;Because rain, or the lack it, can have a big bearing on share-price movements, agricultural stocks should be considered relatively high-risk,&quot; he says.  
&quot;The rewards can be good as a result of disciplined trading and a fair share of luck.&quot;  
Marshall says opportunists buy stocks that appear to be oversold and don&apos;t hesitate to sell them for a profit.  
&quot;It&apos;s time to sell when everything seems to be going well -- the share price is high, bumper crops are on the horizon and the outlook is good.  
Marshall says storage handler Graincorp offers value, as its share price is well off this year&apos;s high of $14.21 and is yet to fully respond to favourable weather.  
Graincorp shares closed at $11.17 on Friday.  
Graincorp&apos;s profits may rise significantly if eastern Australia receives more good rain.  
&quot;Two good years can generate a lot of income from storing grain, as the company receives a handling fee,&quot; Marshall says.

			<TEXT>A volatile cattle market will force Australian Agricultural Co on tothe back foot in the second half but the beef producer still expects toexceed its July prospectus full-year profit forecast by 10 per cent.
Australia&apos;s second biggest pastoral company yesterday revised downwardits most recent full-year profit forecast from $28.1 million to $23.2million, still  more than the $21.1 million prospectus forecast. It saidearnings before interest and tax would be lower than the $43.7 millionforecast in February at $37 million but above its prospectus forecast of$35.7 million.
AACo  with a herd of more than 400,000 head  posted a net profit of$28.14 million for the half year ending December 31 but warned that theoutbreak of mad  cow disease in Japan would force cattle prices to dropsignificantly in the third and fourth quarters.
Due to the SGARA (self generating and regenerating assets) accountingstandard, AACo&apos;s second-half earnings are reliant on beef prices as atJune 30 and the timing and number of cattle sales.
Beef prices have fallen about 13 per cent since December and are notexpected to rebound much in the next two months.
Unless prices recover, AACo will experience a negative SGARAadjustment for the second half, resulting in the lower profit for thefull year compared to the  first half.
SGARA means that a company&apos;s bottom line encounters greater volatilityas commodities prices change and inventory is revalued. There is noimpact on cash flow, however.
On Friday, Futuris Corp  which owns 40 per cent of AACo  hinted itcould be looking at a negative contribution from the beef company whenit announced its own profit downgrade.
AACo said yesterday its latest forecast was based on a net cattleprice increase of 6.8 per cent for the year.
The 178-year-old pastoral company said cattle price expectations forthe fourth quarter had been reduced thanks to US quota limitations,weaker Japanese demand and drier weather.
It also warned that input costs, especially insurance, fuel and grain,were likely to push operating costs 10 per cent higher than in previousforecasts.
AACo chief executive Peter Holmes a Court said the group was able tomove cattle across its vast north Australian property portfolio, whichhelped offset the price downturn and drier weather.

			<TEXT>Australian Agricultural Co (AACo) yesterday reported a 136per centincrease in net profit after tax for the six months to December 31, butthe bullish earnings result failed to titillate investor interest withthe share price easing 2c to 93c.
Since listing on the Australian Stock Exchange in August last year atbelow its $1 retail offer price, AACo, one of the biggest beef producersin the world with 18 cattle stations in Queensland and the NorthernTerritory, has struggled to gain investor support, with the share pricemoving between 72c and 97c.
``There is currently a substantial gap to what the market is valuingus on and the real value of our assets,&apos;&apos; chief financial officer LuisaCatanzaro said.
``We are a novelty. We are the best beef company in the world andpeople have  been struggling to understand the basis on which we accountfor our earnings.&apos;&apos;
Stronger cattle prices drove earnings before interest and tax to $41.2million, up 142 per cent compared with the result for the previouscorresponding  period.
Net profit after tax rose 136 per cent to $28.1 million, aided bycattle revenue up 65 per cent to 68.4 million.
Operating cash flow increased $6.9 million to $7.1 million, reflectinghigher  selling prices, and is expected to rise further in the secondhalf, which overlaps the company&apos;s selling season.
AACo has revised its full-year EBIT up from $35.7 million contained inthe prospectus to $43.7 million and net profit after tax from $21.1million to $28.1  million, assuming a reduction in the average cattleprice in the third quarter of about 7.5 per cent and no change in thefourth quarter.
Analysts were positive about the outlook for AACo and expect the shareprice to rise once investors better understand the company.
``People have got the jury out. ... they want to see what it iscapable of delivering,&apos;&apos; UBS Warburg analyst Michael Peet said. He saidthe use of an accounting standard which valued natural assets such ascattle and wine at market values on the balance date confused investorstrying to ascertain the real value of the company.
As part of its long-term plan to take its brand name beyond the farmgate and  into the retail supermarket, AACo purchased a controllingstake in Melbourne retail butcher Polkinghorne in November.

			<TEXT>A RECORD beef herd helped the Australian Agricultural Company deliver a 22 per cent rise in full-year net profit to $22.2 million in 2003-04 as the cattle market continued to strengthen.  
AACo boosted its herd by 50,000 head of cattle in the year to a record closing inventory of 468,000 at a time when many others are reducing herd sizes.  
Higher cattle prices worldwide and a $40 million land revaluation underpinned the strength in the Brisbane-based company&apos;s balance sheet and acquisition capacity.  
It booked a 37 per cent increase in annual revenue to $159 million.  
While AACo has exited its high-end Victorian butcher shops and reduced its interest in the Jester Jaffle Pie Company to 25 per cent, revenue was boosted by strong sales of its wholesale Wagyu and 1824 branded beef, now sold in 90 restaurants along the east coast.  
Its final and total dividend payout for the year was 6c per share, steady on the previous year.

			<TEXT>FLOODWATERS converging on northern South Australia from cyclonic rains in Queensland have brought optimism to the country.  
It has given grain farmers one of the best starts to a cropping season in years, with a high soil profile moisture.  
Water down the western Queensland rivers is also promising relief for the dry north of SA following a long, hot summer.  
Floods down the Cooper Creek are expected to reach Innamincka in May before flowing on to the Coongie Lakes, providing a good year for tourism in the Far North.  
At South Galway station in western Queensland, manager John Rickertt said the floods were bringing life to the country and heralded a good year for the Channel Country cattle industry. He said water from the Cooper Creek had spread out across a 20km front on the 500,000ha station owned by the Australian Agricultural Company.  
South Australia Farmers Federation western region representative Paul Kaden said grain growers were also optimistic that another front crossing the state last night would bring reasonable rain. &quot;I suspect if we get 10mm of rain or more, that a lot of farmers will be tempted to start seeding in the next week,&quot; he said.  
At the Innamincka Hotel, manager Eric Hanna said a small flow had already arrived down the Cooper Creek with floodwaters expected to reach the town in early and late May.  
Bureau of Meteorology senior forecaster Tom Boeck said the seasonal outlook for May, June and July was for average rainfall for SA, with indications of a La Nina weather pattern.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIA&apos;S biggest beef producer has bought the biggest full-blood herd of Wagyu cattle outside of Japan to treble its output of the premium beef.  
Brisbane-based Australian Agricultural Company yesterday paid $1 million to buy 133 bulls from Australian Wagyu pioneers, the Walker family, from Tarana near Bathurst in New South Wales.  
It has the option of buying the rest of the Westholme Wagyu herd for $9 million.  
The acquisition includes access to embryos, semen and intellectual property.  
Managing director Don Mackay said the company aimed to have 25,000 head of Wagyu cattle from the 8000 it currently marketed.

			<TEXT>AFTER a colourful 180-year history, the  Australian Agricultural Company is facing change with its major shareholder, the  Futuris Corporation, deciding to sell its stake.   
Australia&apos;s largest beef producer runs 631,000 cattle on 24 stations covering 7.9 million hectares of land, about 1.2 per cent of Australia&apos;s land mass.   
Futuris chief executive Les Wozniczka announced the planned sale of the company&apos;s 43 per cent holding in AACo at its annual general meeting in Adelaide yesterday.   
Mr Wozniczka said it was time to realise the value of the investment in AACo, which was floated on the stock exchange in 2002.   
The AACo has grown from a value of $185 million when it was floated, to $640 million on yesterday&apos;s valuation, Mr Wozniczka said.   
Its cattle herd had risen from 348,000 head to 631,000 in the same time, making it the largest cattle company in Australia.   
``Futuris believes AACo to be a wonderful asset,&apos;&apos; Mr Wozniczka said. ``In many ways, AACo is ahead of its time.   
``However, equity markets are yet to adequately recognise the value of AACo in the firm&apos;s share price.   
``As a result, the directors recommend the sale of the shareholding to capture the unrecognised value and enable reinvestment of proceeds within our existing operations, where greater shareholder value can be achieved.&apos;&apos;   
Mr Wozniczka said Futuris had commissioned  Citigroup and Caliburn to conduct a global sale process this financial year. ``If possible, Futuris will try to achieve an outcome that can obtain the support of the AACo board,&apos;&apos; he said.

			<TEXT>GIANT cattle producer  Australian Agricultural Co&apos;s bottom line profit in the half year ended June slid 31 per cent, with factory setup and marketing costs and delayed cattle sales major factors.   
AACo chief executive Don Mackay said yesterday the group&apos;s net profit was $5.9 million, down from $8.5 million during the corresponding period last year.   
Revenue rose from $85.6 million to $124.2 million for the half and a steady interim dividend of 7c will be paid.

			<TEXT>BEEF rather than live cattle will increasingly provide the profits for the nation&apos;s largest cattle business, the  Australian Agricultural Company.
The success of its beef strategy was shown at the company&apos;s annual general meeting yesterday, with an 86 per cent increase in branded beef sales to $74 million last year.   
The dramatic increase from $39.9 million the previous year has the company poised to earn more from beef sales than cattle in future.   
The company, the nation&apos;s oldest company and one of the largest landholders, is owned 42.27 per cent by Adelaide-based  Futuris Corporation.
AACo chief executive Don Mackay said the aim was to market 40 per cent of its total production through its branded beef operations.   
Mr Mackay said its growing branded beef marketing program allowed it to share in the margin throughout the beef supply chain, to deliver higher returns for shareholders with minimal additional capital requirements.   
Its branded beef program is based on beef sales through the 100 per cent owned Chefs Partner, the 1824 beef brand and wagyu beef sales.   
Mr Mackay said the 1824 brand had been introduced in Japan last October, the first step in opening up Asian markets to the firm&apos;s branded products.   
&quot;Another significant step in the development of the 1824 brand is its recent introduction on a trial basis into 50 Woolworths stores in northern New South Wales and Queensland,&quot; he said.   
&quot;This is a very exciting development and an opportunity to further build on our already valuable relationship with Australia&apos;s leading retailer.&quot;   
Mr Mackay said the AACo&apos;s processing capacity for 1824 branded beef had increased from 250 to 550 cattle a week, contributing significantly to its branded sales last year.   
Its goal was to increase capacity to 700 head per week by the end of 2007.

			<TEXT>THE Australian Agricultural Company is on the verge of rivalling the great cattle breeding empire run by the late cattle king, Sir Sydney Kidman, at its peak in the early 1900s.  
The company, owned 42.27 per cent by Adelaide-based Futuris Corporation, yesterday revealed it had built its herd by 11 per cent to 556,558 head on 22 stations across northern Australia last year.  
It is up from 502,866 cattle 12 months ago and nearing the peak herd of about 600,000 cattle run by the Kidman empire in the early 1900s.  
The company aims to double its herd to more than one million head by 2015 and expand its annual sales to 400,000 cattle by then.  
AACo chief executive Don Mackay said in announcing the company&apos;s 2006 results that it sold 199,002 cattle at an average price of $935.40 with revenue of $213 million.  
Founded with a grant of one million acres by an Act of British Parliament 182 years ago, the AACo is involved in what might become its most profitable era.  
The nation&apos;s largest cattle company with assets worth $1.089 billion controls 7.958 million hectares - about 1.2 per cent of the nation&apos;s land area.  
Mr Mackay listed other reasons for optimism as including its increasing move into branding and marketing its own beef, a large Wagyu cattle herd and rising beef demand from Asia.  
He said the drought had forced it to write down its cattle herd valuation by $17.3 million, leading to a 40 per cent fall in full-year profit of $10.1 million.  
But Mr Mackay said cattle prices had already risen by 11 per cent this year.  
&quot;The world has become so engrossed with this thing called climate change that everything that is happening is ascribed to it . . ,&quot; he said. &quot;We all need to be a little more measured than that - northern Australia is enjoying a very good start to the year and the general consensus is that El Nino is breaking down.&quot;  
Mr Mackay said AACo achieved significant growth in its branded beef business with sales revenue rising from $39.9 million in 2005 to $77.8 million last year.

			<TEXT>THE Australian Agricultural Company will sell five of its 26 large northern properties to a land management fund.
The properties, with a book value of about $250 million, will be sold to Primary Holdings International.
The nation&apos;s largest cattle breeder said it would use the money to retire debt and implement a capital management program, including a share buyback.
AACo chief executive Stephen Toms said the proposed transaction was subject to regulatory approvals, negotiation of transaction documents and to Primary Holdings International arranging finance.
AACo runs about 550,000 cattle on its northern properties.
It expects the acquisition consideration payable by PHi will reflect its net tangible assets of $2.79 a share.
Primary Holdings International specialises in agricultural property.
It aims to develop a long-term reputation for building value through sustainable land management and the development of resources and infrastructure.

			<TEXT>BEEF producer Australian Agricultural Co expects to post an earnings loss for calendar 2008 as the global financial crisis forces down beef prices.
Global beef markets are not expected to recover until early next year once import stocks have been run down.
``A fortnight out from our December 31 balance date, it is apparent that the business will report an accounting loss,&apos;&apos; chief executive Stephen Toms said yesterday.
Mr Toms said the global crisis had started directly to affect the market for soft commodities, including beef, in September.
In key markets such as the U.S., Japan and Korea, the failure of some traders and wholesalers to gain access to lines of credit had resulted in reduced orders.
This had caused the price of beef to fall by 9 per cent from an 18-month high of $3.60c a kilogram in September to $3.30c.
``However, the cattle market is unpredictable and significant adjustments can occur in that period, particularly if good rainfall is received over summer months,&apos;&apos; Mr Toms said.
``Therefore the extent of the loss will not be known until the end of January on completion of a full herd analysis and valuation.&apos;&apos;

			<TEXT>THE biggest challenge for agribusiness and automotive parts supplier Futuris Corporation during its restructure will be exiting its non-core assets, according to market analysts.
Futuris said it would undergo a comprehensive overhaul of its diverse operations to focus on its core Elders rural and financial services businesses and timber operations.
Futuris downgraded its earnings forecasts for fiscal 2009 given tough market conditions and announced writedowns and impairments on businesses to be sold, discontinued or retained.
The company also said it would change its name to Elders Ltd.
Futuris said it would discontinue or divest assets that were not relevant to the Elders Ltd business or were not performing. Assets sales are expected to generate about $350 million.
Assets for sale include Futuris&apos; 43 per cent stake in cattle producer Australian Agricultural Company (AACo), and interests in aquaculture, horticulture and abattoirs. Futuris still wishes to sell its automotive operations but has suspended the sales process until markets normalise.
Futuris said the restructuring should put the company in good shape for 2010 and beyond. Citi analyst Jonathan Snape said that if restructuring initiatives went to plan, Futuris could lift underlying profit in 2010 by 80 per cent on the 2009 projection.
``This is an extremely bullish outlook for the business,&apos;&apos; he said.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIAN Agricultural has acquired a Wagyu stud herd for about $1 million and says the outlook for the beef market is strengthening.
The nation&apos;s largest beef producer said yesterday that over the past month cattle market conditions had continued to improve, with beef prices remaining high, a softer Australian dollar exchange rate and falls in
oil prices and interest rates.
Chief executive Stephen Toms said beef prices were still at 18-month highs of 360c a kilo, while export receipts had benefited from the steep decline in the Australian and U.S. dollar exchange rate to about US80c, from US98c in July.
``The decline will boost Australian dollar receipts, particularly on sales into
the U.S. over the next 12 months,&apos;&apos; he said.
AACo said its purchase of the 4JS herd would increase its Wagyu full-blood and purebred production capacity by 50 per cent. The 850-head herd, which is based in North Queensland, will be re-located to AACo&apos;s Surat property, Wylarah, where the primary focus is Wagyu.

			<TEXT>THE nation&apos;s largest beef cattle herd of 565,000 head, owned by the Australian Agricultural Company, reaped total sales of $123.6 million in the first half of 2008.
That helped the company achieve a positive operating cash flow of $5.9 million for the period, compared to a negative $20 million in the previous corresponding period. But the result was not enough to prevent a net after-tax loss of $2.1 million for the six months to June 30, compared with a net profit of $5.9 million in the prior corresponding period.
The company also said acting chief executive and former chief financial officer Stephen Toms would take over as its new chief executive.

But the result was not enough to prevent a net loss after tax of $2.1 million for the six months to June 30, compared with a net profit of $5.9 million in the prior corresponding period.
In presenting its half-year results, the firm announced earnings before interest and tax of $16.049 million, down from $21.3 million in the previous corresponding half.
But the result was up 28 per cent after adjusting for an AMP settlement of $8.8 million net, following litigation over AACo&apos;s failed attempt to buy the Stanbroke Pastoral Company in 2003.
The company also said acting chief executive and former chief financial officer Stephen Toms will takeover as its new chief executive.
``It&apos;s important to note that we are positioning the business to take full advantage of what we anticipate will be a rapid increase in cattle prices during the remainder of the year,&apos;&apos; Mr Toms said.
Prices had rallied from $3.15 to $3.40 a kilo in the first half of 2008 to $3.53 a kilo in recent weeks, he said.
Mr Toms said the beef giant sold 121,559 cattle for the period, well up on the previous figure of 65,587, mainly due to drought on its Barkly Tableland properties.
The company declared a dividend of 7c a share, payable in mid-October.

			<TEXT>FUTURIS director Charles Bright has been appointed acting chairman of the Australian Agricultural Company board.
It follows the departure of previous chairman Nick Burton Taylor at the company&apos;s annual general meeting on Wednesday.
Mr Burton Taylor was advised by Futuris Corporation chief executive Les Wozniczka on Monday that his re-election would not be supported.
Futuris owns 43 per cent of the Australian Agricultural Company, the nation&apos;s largest beef producer with a cattle herd of close to 600,000 head.
The company also announced it was appointing environmentalist Philip Toyne to the board.
Mr Toyne will fill one of the vacancies arising from the departures of Mr Burton Taylor and directors Chris Roberts and Greg Paramor at the AGM.
Futuris said that more independent non-executive directors would be appointed as a result of a recruitment process. It also appointed chief financial officer Stephen Toms to acting chief executive officer, as it pursues the appointment of a permanent chief executive officer.

			<TEXT>A BITTER dispute between Futuris Corporation management and its 43 per cent owned Australian Agricultural Company flared at the cattle company&apos;s annual general meeting in Brisbane yesterday.
Chairman Nick Burton Taylor was unseated at the meeting, but not before he strongly criticised Futuris.
He has also been acting as chief executive of the nation&apos;s largest cattle firm since its managing director Don Mackay was replaced.
Mr Burton Taylor had been advised by Futuris chief executive Les Wozniczka on Monday that his re-election would not be supported yesterday.
``Non-executive directors and particularly independent directors accept the risks and obligations of office, but in return accept the ethical processes of managing a board to be met,&apos;&apos; Mr Burton Taylor said.
``Many of these are articulated in our board charter and have at their heart the protection and well-being of the company, its shareholders and its staff.
``I do not believe the processes followed over the past week by our major shareholder Futuris meet these standards,&apos;&apos; he said.
Mr Burton Taylor said he had been exposed to a number of reasons put forward for his removal in the previous 48 hours.
``Most seem to centre on two aspects of my chairmanship,&apos;&apos; he said.
``Firstly, that the independent directors and myself in particular sought to obstruct the sale of the Futuris stake in this company. This I totally refute.
``Secondly, it is asserted that I am too passionate concerning the company to effectively replace myself in the CEO role, and that I would not have the objective capacity to introduce a new CEO to the company.&apos;&apos;
Mr Burton Taylor said he did not accept this proposition and was the first to recognise that fulfilling both tasks was unsustainable and undesirable, other than in the short term
``As a director one cannot step in and out of the ring of responsibility when one chooses.
``To pretend that the Futuris view has somehow been silenced since we refloated in 2001 is mischievious.&apos;&apos;
But a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange by Futuris corporate director Michael Sadlon said the decision to not support the re-election of Mr Burton Taylor had not been taken lightly.
`It has been taken only after close consideration of what alternatives might have been available to us to achieve a unified board to take this company forward from today,&apos;&apos; Mr Sadlon said.
``We no longer believe that Mr Burton Taylor is in a position to lead a cohesive board for all AAco shareholders.&apos;&apos;
Fellow directors Greg Paramour and Chris Roberts also resigned at yesterday&apos;s meeting.
``We no longer believe that Mr Burton Taylor is in a position to lead a cohesive board for all AAco shareholders. - Futuris
``I do not believe the processes followed over the past week by our major shareholder Futuris meet these (ethical) standards. - Nick Burton Taylor

			<TEXT>FUTURIS will be fighting for full control of Australian Agricultural Co. today, seeking to oust the chairman but facing board disarray if two directors carry out a threat to resign in protest.
Diversified group and Adelaide-based Futuris plans to wield its 43 per cent stake to eject Australian Agriculture chairman and acting chief executive Nick Burton Taylor.

			<TEXT>FUTURIS executives moved to calm market sentiment yesterday over its aborted sale of a 43 per cent stake in Australian Agricultural Company.
As Futuris shares slumped more than 11 per cent - down 24c to $1.87 - chief executive Les Wozniczka told analysts in a briefing late yesterday that despite significant interest in the AACo stake, no proposals had certainty of execution or timing.
``When we decided to put the AACo stake up for sale in October, seasonal conditions were pretty poor . . . a lot of things have changed over that time,&apos;&apos; he said.
``The important thing for us is to have certainty and taking everything into account we thought the better thing was call an end to the process.&apos;&apos;
Goldman Sachs JBWere analyst Andrew Gibson had earlier downgraded his recommendation from ``buy&apos;&apos; to ``hold&apos;&apos; on Futuris shares, after raising concerns about Futuris&apos; debt levels without the AACo sale, proceeds from which were to retire debt.
``The termination of this sale process means we now expect a higher debt position going forward and hence a higher interest charge,&apos;&apos; Mr Gibson said.
Futuris chief financial officer Peter Zachert said debt would climb from $350 million to $500 million by the end of financial year, putting the company&apos;s debt at about 25 per cent of equity. ``I think it&apos;s great to be in this current environment with a conservative gearing. We do not want to go above 30 per cent gearing,&apos;&apos; Mr Zachert said.
However, the aborted sale lessened asset buying opportunities for the diversified company.
``Values have significantly fallen - there are a lot of opportunities we would like to deal with,&apos;&apos; Mr Wozniczka said.
``But I think the first priority for us is that acquisitions are secondary to promoting growth going forward.&apos;&apos;
AACo said its landholdings had lured ``a high level of market interest&apos;&apos; and it had a responsibility to deliver shareholder value on those assets.
``Our assets were rated highly. We saw that as a positive signal out of the process,&apos;&apos; AACo spokesman Nick Burton Taylor said yesterday.
``We&apos;ll continue to acquire and selectively trim the portfolio to improve performance.&apos;&apos;
Futuris reiterated to the market that its pre-tax earnings before interest this financial year would be at the upper end of expectations of $154 million to $183 million, while full year underlying profit was expected to be around $100 million, depending upon continued good rainfall and sales of managed investment schemes.

			<TEXT>CITY investors will be able to buy into broadacre farming as the rural sector experiences a surge in alternative land-tenure practices.   
The rising price of agricultural commodities is expected to help attract city investors to the farming sector.   
In the latest development, Australian Agricultural Contracts Ltd has announced the establishment of its contract farming system into South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland this year.   
Meanwhile, European commodity giant Glencore is leasing significant areas of cropping land in southern Australia, particularly SA and the western district of Victoria.   
The AACL share farming model involves the use of urban money in cropping through managed investment funds.   
Western Australian-based AACL&apos;s founder, Andrew McBain, said he expected it to build a significant national operation in the next decade.   
AACL South Australian representative Ray Scheid said the company expected to have a few thousand hectares involved in SA this year, but the big move would come next year. Mr Scheid said that in a good year the farmer would receive 90 per cent of the income above a base level once the investor received back their capital and a set return.   
Mr McBain founded the business in 1997 and plans to produce about $120 million worth of crops in partnership with more than 200 farmers this year.   
The company successfully expanded its model to encompass 130,000ha of wheat production with 113 farmers throughout WA in 2007.   
Mr McBain said he developed the model because of his work as an accountant, and a family involvement in farming.   
Continued Page 36   
Buying in the bush has growing appeal   
From Page 35   
He believed it would help resolve some of the traditional structural problems of farming including an average age of 56, the requirement for large amounts of capital and the need for multi-peril crop insurance.   
Mr McBain said AACL had the potential to grow 10-20 per cent of the national wheat and barley crop in eight years. ``We&apos;re developing a land fund where the farmers lease the land and we share the capital growth,&apos;&apos; he said.   
``It means they can grow their business quicker and invest outside farming if they want to.&apos;&apos;   
The AACL model is designed to keep the farmer in a system where he (or she) has incentives to do the best possible job. Mr McBain said the plan was tax deductible to investors, but they would only invest because they expected to make money.   
Rural Directions grain marketing services manager Chris Heinjus said the move was good for agriculture and would provide numerous benefits. He believed it would help overcome the problems of ageing farmers and the skills shortage.

			<TEXT>THE  Australian Agricultural Company has been struggling to make a sizeable profit for much of its history since its formation by an Act of the British Parliament in 1824.   
The difficulties of managing large areas of land across Australia&apos;s north still appear to be troubling the nation&apos;s largest cattle producer. Despite a herd of 588,180 cattle it recorded a sharp $6.5 million decline in net profit after tax to only $3.6 million in 2007.   
But on a return-to-shareholders basis in the past five years it is performing as strongly as any public agricultural producer.   
Chairman and acting chief executive Nick Burton Taylor said total shareholder return on a $10,000 investment in the past five years had reached more than $40,000.   
In comparison with other listed agricultural companies, AACo had earnt a total annual shareholders&apos; return of 34 per cent, equal to that of  Timbercorp Limited, in the past five years.   
Other rural-based companies behind it included ABB Grain on 29 per cent,  Select Harvests Ltd 29 per cent,  Gunns Ltd 18 per cent,  Futuris Corporation 17 per cent and  Graincorp Ltd with 6 per cent.   
The upside of AACo&apos;s result included a 22 per cent increase in net tangible assets a share from $2.28 to $2.78, following a $203 million revaluation of its properties.   
Mr Burton Taylor said key operational highlights included a 7 per cent rise in its beef production to 78 million kilograms, an improved calving rate of 74 per cent and herd growth of 5.7 per cent.   
The company also increased its wagyu breeding herd by 5000 cattle. Strategically it also increased its wholesale meat revenues by 36 per cent from $77.8 million to $105.6 million.   
AACo&apos;s revenue from operating activities rose 27 per cent to $248.98 million for the year, partly due to higher sales of its branded beef products.   
AACo said is working with  Futuris Corporation Ltd to determine how best to dispose of its 43pc stake.   
A final dividend will be advised at its annual meeting and paid in October.   
AACo shares closed at $2.98, down 2.3pc.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIA&apos;S biggest cattle owner yesterday lost its chief executive amid speculation major shareholder Futuris had received a bid for its stake.   
Don Mackay yesterday resigned from Brisbane-based  Australian Agricultural Company with a short statement saying the move was amicable.   
``The change to AACo management was initiated by the board in response to anticipated commercial opportunities and circumstances facing the company,&apos;&apos; the statement said.   
Neither Mr Mackay nor chairman Nick Burton Taylor were available for comment. Adelaide-based Futuris, which holds a 43 per cent stake in AACo, announced in October it wanted to relinquish its stake and appointed  Citigroup and Caliburn Partners to find a buyer.   
At the time,  Macquarie Bank&apos;s new pastoral arm was touted as a possible buyer as were overseas commodities companies.   
Speculation in the market yesterday was that Futuris had received a bid for its stake, which would also trigger a full takeover offer for AACo as it is above the 19.9 per cent threshold.   
A spokesman for Futuris did not return calls yesterday. Mr Burton Taylor will assume the role of chief executive while a recruitment search goes on.   
ABN Amro Morgans analyst Belinda Moore said Mr Mackay had a well-regarded history in agribusiness.   
``We believe the timing is interesting given the corporate activity,&apos;&apos; Ms Moore said.   
AACo is due to report its full year year results on February 6 and Futuris the following day.   
AACo shares fell 10 per cent to $3.14 and Futuris fell 7 per cent to $2.15.

			<TEXT>Melbourne meat retailer Polkinghorne&apos;s may become the basis of anational chain after Peter Holmes a Court&apos;s Australian AgriculturalCompany took a controlling stake in it yesterday.
AACo will pay $750,000 for 51per cent of the new company. The rest isowned by Polkinghorne&apos;s founders, Rod Polkinghorne and Judy Philpott.AACo has the option later to buy them out.
AACo said the purchase was part of a plan to sell standardised beefusing types developed by Meat Standards Australia.
``While we are today Australia&apos;s biggest MSA beef producer, we do notcontrol  the quality of our product beyond the farm gate,&apos;&apos; Mr Holmes aCourt said.
``The acquisition of Polkinghorne&apos;s gives us R&amp;D and a brand name inits early stage.&apos;&apos;
This would allow AACo to imitate United States producers that he saidhad used brand-name marketing to turn around decades of declining beefconsumption.
Mr Holmes a Court said Polkinghorne&apos;s, which at present operates asingle retail store in Albert Park, was ``profitable at an operatinglevel&apos;&apos; and would be earnings-positive by 2003.
He said AACo would open new company-owned or franchise stores inVictoria and  later interstate along the ``footprint of Brumby&apos;s orBaker&apos;s Delight&apos;s high-street format&apos;&apos;.
In addition, the joint venture would distribute ``retail-ready&apos;&apos;Polkinghorne&apos;s brand meats and prepared meals into supermarkets.
Mr Polkinghorne has been a major player in the development of the MSAsystem over the past 10years, according to AACo.
Mr Polkinghorne said yesterday that the company used a mixture of MSAmeat types and its own brand names to sell meat across all pricepoints, rather than only in the top premium category.
``A lot of beef branding is at an elitist level, and that&apos;s not muchof a challenge. But if you&apos;re going to control the supply chain, you&apos;vegot to sell the whole animal,&apos;&apos; he said.
Mr Polkinghorne said many young consumers felt guilty about buyingbeef that did not cook well, when instead there were scientific reasonswhy some meat types worked.
``The things that make up a good bit of beef aren&apos;t visible,&apos;&apos; hesaid. ``There are high-price meats that will eat terribly, and low-pricemeats that cook quite well.&apos;&apos;
AACo listed on the Australian Stock Exchange in August after a $200million float. The stock was issued at $1, but has since languisheddespite strong beef prices that have enabled the company to promise tobeat its prospectus forecast of 22per cent profit growth this financialyear.
The shares closed yesterday at 84 cents, up 0.6 of a cent.

			<TEXT>Recently listed beef producer Australian Agricultural Company hasteamed with prominent brand name R.M. Williams to offer a shareholderdiscount card.
The companies said the discount card would offer AACo shareholders a15 per cent discount at R.M. Williams stores over the next year.
``We share a common heritage of rural Australia, and after providingso many company properties with R.M. Williams boots and apparel over theyears, we look forward to developing further initiatives,&apos;&apos; said R.M.Williams chief executive Hamish Turner.
AACo, spun off from Futuris Corp this year in a heavily oversubscribed$111 million float, plans to broaden the offerings of the shareholdercard soon.
The company announced last month that it expected to exceed prospectusforecasts of a 22 per cent rise in earnings, thanks to higher cattleprices, increased sales and increases in herd values for accountingpurposes.
Earnings in the three months to September 30 more than doubled from$8.3 million to $17.1 million.
However, AACo shares fell one cent to 82 cents yesterday.
They have traded below their $1 issue price since the float, whichmarked a return to the sharemarket for the 177-year-old company. It wasfirst listed in 1974, but Elders acquired it in 1995.
AACo hopes to increase its herd of 380,000 beasts in the NorthernTerritory and Queensland to more than one million, before expanding intothe meat-processing industry.
The owners of almost 90 per cent of R.M. Williams - media figures KenCowley and Kerry Stokes - this year were forced to indemnify themselvesagainst losses arising from the company&apos;s $3.5 million investment in thecollapsed airline Qantas New Zealand. At the time, minority shareholdersquestioned the diversification away from the core apparel business.

			<TEXT>By any measure, one of the less successful floats this year has beenPeter  Holmes a Court&apos;s Australian Agricultural Company, a cattlebusiness spun off by  Futuris.
Before AACo made its sharemarket debut, the shares were as rare ashen&apos;s teeth but since then things have changed. Issued at $1, the stockshed one cent on its first day and has been sliding down ever since.
Yesterday the shares closed at 79 cents. Despite this, Mr Holmes aCourt (the  oldest son of Robert) has not lost faith and on Monday divedinto the market, snapping up 50,000 shares at 73 cents a hoof.
Mr Holmes a Court now holds 15,050,000 AACo shares, giving him an 8per cent stake in the company.
A more successful investment would have been to buy Banksia Winesbefore Lion  Nathan made its $68million friendly bid for theAdelaide-based company.
For Banksia deputy chairman Tony Johnson, this is exactly whatTirroki -a trustee of his superannuation fund - did on September 18,buying a further 41,500 shares.
At the time, the shares were worth 77 cents. Yesterday Banksia closedat $1.14.

			<TEXT>AWB, the nation&apos;s monopoly wheat exporter, made a strong sharemarketdebut  yesterday, completing its 62-year transformation fromgovernment-owned body to publicly listed company.
After the failure of the Australian Agricultural Company to list at apremium, AWB chairman Trevor Flugge was understandably pleased to seethe stock exchange&apos;s latest rural venture hit the boards at $3.42, wellabove its $3.15 offer price.
``We&apos;re throwing off the shackles of government, we&apos;re throwing offthe shackles of history, where we&apos;ve had total regulation,&apos;&apos; he said.
The float, underwritten by UBS Warburg, closed heavily oversubscribedand, at  yesterday&apos;s $3.47 close, gives AWB a market capitilisation of$948million.
The wheat marketer and financer raised $100million through the issueof 31.8million shares, or 12 per cent of AWB&apos;s issued capital. Sixtyper cent of that went to institutional investors, including Graincorp,which now holds a 3.5  per cent stake.
Because the bulk of issued capital is owned by farmers, who alsocontrol AWB&apos;s board, long-term liquidity and institutional support areregarded as crucial to the success of the share price.
The sharemarket debut also comes at a time when farmers are enjoyingwheat prices at four-year highs, with Australia expected to produce aharvest close to  the average 21 million tonnes.
AWB chief executive Andrew Lindberg said recent falls in the benchmarkwheat price and the resurgent Australian dollar would not pose a problemfor the company.
``The most important factor affecting the company&apos;s earnings is wheatharvest  volumes,&apos;&apos; he said.
``Over the long term, we have been producing 2 per cent more grain perannum and we can continue to do that.&apos;&apos;

The cattle group Australian Agricultural Company has taken over thePerth-based Jesters Jaffle Pie Company as part of its strategy to establishquality beef retail outlets.
AACo bought Jesters from its managing director, Richard Anderson, andexecutive director, Bill Richardson. Mr Anderson and Mr Richardson will joinAACo to help expand the Jesters business.
The acquisition, which will be financed by cash and equity, is believed tohave cost between $2 million and $3 million.
Jesters stores serve high-quality beef and other pies, cooked in storedaily, using a jaffle-iron cooking method. The company aims to offer ahealthy alternative to other fast-food outlets by using quality ingredientsand ultra-thin puff pastry.
The acquisition comprises two business units, a centralised cooking plantthat supplies stores with pie fillings and a retail franchising system. Theprofitable business has 31 franchised stores in and around Perth, and onelicensed New Zealand store.
In line with AACo&apos;s &quot;paddock to plate&quot; value-chain strategy, the acquisitionof Jesters brings another quality brand to the AACo portfolio, andcomplements the high-quality beef retailer Polkinghornes.
AACo will supply beef to all the Jesters franchised stores, which areforecast to turn over more than $10 million this financial year. Jesterswill receive royalty income, as well as income from the supply of cookedingredients to the franchised stores.
Jesters has grown from a single store in 1998. Mr Anderson said it wouldexpand on the east coast and pursue international licensing opportunitiesnext year.

			<TEXT>A second Polkinghornes shop selling high-quality beef would open inMelbourne in eight weeks, the Australian Agricultural Company announcedyesterday as it reported a 30 per cent rise in profit in its first full yearas a listed company.
A second Polkinghornes shop selling high-quality beef would open inMelbourne in eight weeks, the Australian Agricultural Company announcedyesterday as it reported a 30 per cent rise in profit in its first full yearas a listed company.
However, earnings in 2002-03 would be 10 to 20 per cent below this year&apos;s,the company warned, due to higher operating costs, including supplementalfeeding, grain and cattle expenses, driven by drier conditions.
AACo is well placed for acquisitions, with gearing (net debt/total equity)at 29.6 per cent. This rate could be described as &quot;lazy&quot;, chief financialofficer Luisa Catanzaro said, but had created a great foundation for growth.
AACo&apos;s net profit after tax (NPAT) for the year to June 30 was $20.6million, 30 per cent higher than the normalised result from the year before.AACo listed on August 10 last year.
Earnings before interest and tax rose 12 per cent to $32.8 million as aresult of increased cattle revenue. Sales revenue increased from $82 millionto $94 million, while the market value of the company&apos;s herd finished theyear 5 per cent larger at 407,000 head.
Average cattle prices were higher than the financial year before, but theexecutive director of operations, Don Mackay, said prices had varied by 34per cent in the 12 months to June 30.
Operating cashflow before interest and tax grew by more than 45 per cent to$25.5 million despite higher grain prices and operating costs.
The company declared a fully franked dividend of 6.1 cents a share. MsCatanzaro said the dividend was one of the highest on the market, with ayield of more than 9 per cent.
AACo announced during the year the 51 per cent acquisition of RuralManagement Partners, a management company with 16 companies and 60,000 headof cattle. RMP is expected to deliver management income and allow AACo tofocus on breed development and herd management.
AACo chief executive Peter Holmes a Court said the year had been difficult,showing the best and worst of the cattle industry.
The first case of BSE, or mad cow disease, occurred on September 10,followed the next day by events in the United States. The US market was alsoaffected by the confusion surrounding the US beef quota. Domestically, dryconditions, particularly in New South Wales, led to many low-grade cattlebeing sold, dramatically pushing down record prices.
Despite the challenges, AACo finished within 2 per cent of its NPATprospectus target.
Mr Holmes a Court said the group&apos;s properties, geographically spread, hadgood stocks of water and feed and were not affected by the drought, whichwas further south. Export conditions were also improving, particularly inKorea and Japan.
He said the growth outlook was strong. AACo&apos;s supply of beef to its ownbrands such as Polkinghornes, Chefs Partner and the new &quot;1824&quot; beef brandwould provide big opportunities.
Other growth drivers were low supply of quality cattle, recovery of theJapanese export market, resolution of the US beef quota issue and risingcattle prices.
AACo shares finished five cents or 7.14 per cent higher at 75 cents.

			<TEXT>IT&apos;S A funny thing, agribusiness. While the economy was built on thesheep&apos;s back, to say nothing of sugar cane, beef or wheat, this sectorhas never  attracted much equity. Historically, that is largely due tothe predominance of  the family as the quintessential farming unit buteven today, in an industry where big is typically better and healthydollops of capital are required, this sector still represents aminiscule percentage of the sharemarket&apos;s total capitalisation.
That said, publicly listed agribusinesses have enjoyed a markedresurgence of  roughly 30 per cent in the past year. Of the seven stockswe examined in this sector (the list is not exhaustive and deliberatelyexcludes plantation stocks, such as Wilmott Forests and ForestEnterprises), five have shown solid gains over the past year. In thecase of Ruralco (it changed its name from Grow Force Australia on March1, 2002, after merging with Ruralco in January, 2001), the share pricehas nearly doubled. The grain logistics group, Graincorp, has added 42per cent.
The only losers are recently listed Australian Agricultural (thesecondbiggest cattle producer with a herd of 400,000 spread over 6.5million hectares in Queensland and the Northern Territory), which isdown 12 per cent, and Futuris Corp, which boasts a rural servicesdivision, down 21 per cent.
That agribusiness is proving a tasty investment is not surprising.What is often forgotten is the sheer size of this country&apos;s agriculturalsector. Sheep and cattle outnumber people seven to one on thiscontinent. Crops under acreage border on 20 million hectares.
This financial year (20012002), the Australian Bureau of Agriculturaland Resource Economics (ABARE) predicts net farm income of nearly $8billion - the highest in more than two decades. Exports are tipped toexceed $31 billion, and while ABARE expects the combination of a higherAustralian dollar and lower prices for some key commodities - wool,sugar and dairy products - to drop in 20022003, there will still be somecream left for the farming community.
But that&apos;s in the future. And ABARE&apos;s crystal ball might prove overlypessimistic.
In the meantime, most rural producers are enjoying higher prices.
Wool growers are getting on average 5 per cent more this financialyear compared with last financial year, while wheat prices are up 7 percent.
But beef producers are making the biggest killing of all with pricesup by nearly 20 per cent. The main exceptions are sugar and cotton ordroughtaffected areas, notably parts of Queensland.
It&apos;s not just a factor of higher prices and a lower dollar. Many ofthe industry&apos;s sectors have been restructured (often at high socialcost) as marketsupport schemes (dairy and wool are examples) have cometo a timely end and farm economics have improved.
Macroeconomic factors have been at work, too. Interest rates are lowand so, too, are fuel prices. It is a profitable combination.
So how have individual stocks fared?
Australian Agricultural (40 per cent owned by Futuris and headed byPeter Holmes a Court) is a good starting point for the very reason thatit highlights the vagaries of investing in this sector.
Beef prices are high. Australian beef has been in demand, in partbecause it has not been tainted by the scare of mad cows&apos; disease. Butthat could be a negative as well as a positive.
In the long term, will the threat of disease reduce overall beefconsumption,  especially in Japan, our prime export market?
Whatever the answer, the fact is that Australian Agricultural hasnotched up a handsome profit in the six months to December 31, 2001,with a 136 per cent jump in net earnings to $28.1 million. There was nodividend, yet its highest share price was $1 on the day it listed onAugust 9, 2001, and it has been as low as 72 cents on September 17. Ataround 90 cents - its current trading range - it&apos;s on a cheappriceearnings multiple of six. But the market is yet to be convinced.
The agricultural chemicals producer Nufarm remains confident ofshrugging off  a lower interim profit of $5.6 million to January 31,2002, and notching doubledigit growth for the full year.
The market has accepted managing director Doug Rathbone&apos;s explanationthat the nature of the business (farmers buying their products beforeplanting) means  most of the profit will be earned in the second half,and has pushed the share price ahead by nearly 50 per cent in the pastyear.
Queensland Cotton struggled in its last financial year to February 28,2002. Its net profit was down 10 per cent to $13.6 million but the boardstill managed  to get a 30cent dividend back into shareholders&apos; pocketsfor the financial year. A share price of $3.60 puts Queensland Cotton ona handy historical dividend yield of 8.3 per cent.
The wheat marketing body, AWB, which handles a massive 16 per cent ofworld wheat exports, lifted its inaugural net profit by 32 per cent to$84 million for  the 12 months to September 31, 2001. Investors haveenjoyed its performance, too. Since listing in August at $3.15, it hasmatched the performance of Graincorp by gaining about 30 per cent.
Ruralco has enjoyed the strongest market resurgence. But this thinlytraded stock needed to get some runs on the board. Despite a short,sharp rally in late  1998, it has been on a downward spiral since 1997,only turning the corner late  last year.
Ruralco, which provides irrigation equipment, fertilisers, chemicals,packaging and seeds, is well established in northern New South Wales andQueensland.
Investors are now punting that the synergies achieved in last year&apos;smerger will provide the base for a more profitable future.
Bullish ABARE predictions and sound macro settings are underpinningthis rural upturn. Tractor sales are up and even posh boarding schoolsare benefiting.
But investors beware. No industry is more cyclical. Investors shouldremain abreast of market trends. Not to do so will leave you exposedwhen the downturn inevitably comes.

			<TEXT>Strong cattle prices and higher beef sales have propelled thehalf-year earnings of Peter Holmes a Court&apos;s Australian AgriculturalCompany skyward.
The pastoral company, a subsidiary of Futuris Corporation that listedlast August, yesterday reported earnings before interest and tax (EBIT)of $41.2 million for the six months to December 31, 2001, an increase of142 per cent over the $17 million in the previous corresponding period.
Net profit after tax for the period rose 136per cent to $28.1million,from $11.9 million.
However, about half the EBIT increase, $21.3 million, was due to achange in accounting methods. Market-value accounting has replacedabsorption-cost accounting, which is based on historical prices.
Underlying EBIT for the six months, after normalising for managementfees before the float, was $19.9 million, up 120per cent from $8.8million.
The strong result has enabled AACo to revise its earnings for the fullfinancial year upwards by 15 per cent beyond its prospectus forecast.
Despite the danger of volatile cattle prices, the company now expectsfull-year EBIT to be $43.7 million, 23 per cent above the prospectusforecast. Net profit after tax is forecast to be $28.1million, a rise of33 per cent against the prospectus.
These forecasts assume a reduction in the average cattle price in thethird quarter of about 7.5 per cent, and no change in the fourthquarter.
The upward revision is based on a net cattle price rise of about 7 percent above the previous year compared with the 3 per cent on which theprospectus forecast was based.
The company did not pay an interim dividend.
The cumulative cattle price increase for the six-month period was 15.5per cent. Factors such as the outbreak of mad cow disease in Japanpushed cattle prices down late last year, which may affect prices in theshort term, especially in the third quarter of the current financialyear. Prices in january  were 5per cent to 7per cent down on December.

			<TEXT>Calls to label Australian beef exports free of mad cow disease havebeen rebuffed by federal Agriculture Minister Warren Truss.
The Victorian Farmers Federation yesterday called for the FederalGovernment to certify and label Australian beef exports free of bovinespongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, to bolster the confidence ofinternational markets in the wake of outbreaks of the disease in Japanand Europe.
The federation&apos;s cattle committee chairwoman, Ailsa Fox, said thegovernment should act quickly to publicly affirm the BSE-free status ofAustralian beef in the light of moves by major market rival the UnitedStates to label its meat exports to Japan of low BSE risk.
The proposal was backed by the nation&apos;s second-largest beef producer,Australian Agricultural Company (AACo).
But a spokesman for Mr Truss said it was unnecessary to certify andlabel exports to Japan as BSE-free because the market already regardedAustralian meat  as safe.
Mrs Fox said the minister&apos;s response was ``fairly disappointing(because) we have to keep up with what our competitors are doing&apos;&apos;.
The confidence of the Japanese meat market, which is highly sensitiveto issues of food safety, was badly jolted by the discovery of BSE inlocal cattle in September. BSE is widely suspected of being linked tothe onset of Variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease in humans.
Japan is Australia&apos;s most valuable beef export market, with salesreaching $1.7 billion for the year.
Mrs Fox said Australia was one of only 16 countries in the world tohave been  given a category-one rating by the European Union, signifyingthe lowest possible BSE risk. The US was classified as a category-twocountry, where the risk of BSE was low but could not be excluded.
Mrs Fox said Australia should act to ensure its higher risk-freestatus was internationally recognised.
``In addition to certifying our beef exports as BSE-free, it isimportant the  government negotiates appropriate international standardsfor BSE-related labelling,&apos;&apos; she said. Peak industry body Meat andLivestock Australia&apos;s communications general manager, David Palmer, saidby the time Australian beef reached Japanese butcher shops andsupermarket shelves, it was usually recut and  repackaged, and consumerswould not necessarily identify it as Australian.
Instead, the beef industry had worked to build understanding andknowledge among Japanese meat retailers and restaurateurs about thequality of Australian meat, backed by television and newspaperadvertising campaigns.
The effect, Mr Palmer said, was that the Australian brand was seen assynonymous with clean, green, disease-free food.
Australian Meat Council executive officer Patrick Hutchinson said hewas concerned the introduction of BSE-free certification would requirethe creation of an expensive testing and auditing regime for littlecommercial benefit.
Mr Truss&apos;s spokesman said Japanese authorities already recognisedAustralia&apos;s  category-one status. The issue of food safety andlabelling, including its application to BSE, would be on the agenda of ameeting of agriculture ministers  from Australia, the US, Canada, Japanand the European Union in Japan later this month.

			<TEXT>Sydney -- An AMP Henderson executive admitted in court yesterday that a media statement released after the sale of the Stanbroke cattle empire was &quot;factually incorrect&quot;.   
AMP Henderson director Marcus Derwin was giving evidence as hostilities between Peter Holmes a Court&apos;s Australian Agricultural Co (AACo) and AMP over the $490 million sale of Stanbroke resumed in the Federal Court.   
The media statement was released on September 9 and had meant to put a good spin on the purchase of Stanbroke&apos;s 11.7 million hectares and 500,000 head of cattle by Nebo Holdings, a group of wealthy Queensland families backed by burger king Jack Cowin.   
Instead its contents were probed by AACo counsel Douglas Meagher, and produced admissions by Mr Derwin that the release was &quot;factually incorrect&quot; and a &quot;media play&quot;.   
Mr Meagher seized on comments made by Mr Derwin in the press release. &quot;In making our final decision, many considerations were taken, including the final offer price and (Nebo&apos;s) intent to preserve (Stanbroke) as an ongoing concern,&quot; it had said it part.   
AACo, which is seeking an injunction to stop the sale being completed, not only claims its bid was at least $2.5 million higher (depending on completion adjustments) but that Nebo had been favoured because it planned to &quot;preserve&quot; Stanbroke.   
AMP, however, has argued the &quot;preservation&quot; of Stanbroke played no part in the decision-making process, and that Nebo&apos;s bid was for a similar price and contained less onerous conditions.   
Under intense cross-examination, Mr Derwin gave a series of vague answers about the accuracy of the press release. He eventually admitted the statement was &quot;probably factually incorrect&quot; and that &quot;price, price and price&quot; had been the most important factor in determining the successful bidder.   
Asked by Mr Meagher if it was &quot;correct to lie to the public&quot;, Mr Derwin replied: &quot;The words say what the words say.&quot;   
Mr Derwin admitted one of the aims of the press release had been to reassure Stanbroke&apos;s 600 staff that their jobs were safe. AACo had planned to merge Stanbroke&apos;s operations with its own, leading to possible redundancies.   
AACo had alleged that, in April, Nebo director Peter Hughes wrote to Mr Derwin confirming his intention to keep Stanbroke together and retain management as he had heard it was a concern of AMP&apos;s.   
Although Mr Derwin also admitted to helping draw up Nebo&apos;s final offer document - a bid he accepted later that day on behalf of AMP - he maintained the decision process had been objective.   
Earlier in the day, Nebo and AMP&apos;s lawyers expressed outrage over previous allegations of collusion between the two parties.

			<TEXT>AMP Life yesterday gave an undertaking to the Federal Court in Sydney that it would not sell the cattle producer Stanbroke Pastoral pending the hearing of an injunction application launched by Peter Holmes a Court&apos;s Australian Agricultural Co.   
Justice Michael Moore yesterday scheduled a hearing for Wednesday, when the court is likely to hear argument from AMP Life and AMP Henderson over why they rejected three offers from AACo.   
AMP Life and AMP Henderson, the manager of the Stanbroke portfolio of cattle stations, on September 9 revealed they would sell Stanbroke for $490 million including debt to a consortium of investors.   
The consortium, known as Nebo, was led by a Stanbroke director, Peter Hughes, and wealthy Victorian-based cattle baron Peter Menegazzo.   
But AACo on Thursday launched action to block the sale, arguing that each of its three offers - including two submitted after the close of formal bids - exceeded the Nebo bid on price alone.   
In documents filed with the court, AACo has claimed that its highest offer totalled $541 million including debt, and that several times during the sale process AMP Life and AMP Henderson had said their decision on the winning bid would be a matter of maximising value for policyholders. AACo has alleged that AMP Life and AMP Henderson did not inform it that one of the vendor&apos;s conditions was that Stanbroke could not be merged and that, because AMP&apos;s officers did not inform AACo of the condition, the vendors had acted in a misleading and deceptive manner.   
&quot;We will be objecting to AACo&apos;s application for the injunction vigorously,&quot; an AMP Henderson spokesman said yesterday.

A Greek shipping tycoon and perhaps the country&apos;s largest funds manager willdo battle with Peter Holmes a Court for Stanbroke Pastoral, AMP Life&apos;s 11.7million hectares of prime cattle country.
With the sale of Australia&apos;s largest pastoral company expected to fetch $400million, a syndicate led by Gregory Hadjieleftheriadis&apos; Alice SpringsPastoral yesterday confirmed it had joined Mr Holmes a Court&apos;s AustralianAgricultural Company on AMP&apos;s shortlist of buyers.
The two are expected to pitch aggressively for AMP&apos;s vast cattle empire,with the country&apos;s second largest pastoral group, S Kidman &amp; Co, rulingitself out of the race.
Mr Hadjieleftheriadis, who lives in Athens and is married to an Australian,has called Stanbroke &quot;the jewel in the crown of Australia&apos;s pastoralindustry&quot;.
Aaco, the giant cattle group run by Mr Holmes a Court, on Monday confirmedthat it had been invited to stay in the hunt.
More surprising is speculation that Colonial Agricultural Company is alsoparticipating in the second stage of the sale. The second stage involves duediligence. Colonial Agricultural is managed by Fred Grimwade for ColonialFirst State.
Aaco shares yesterday closed unchanged at 93.

			<TEXT>Rising beef prices and the benefits of heavy rain in Queensland and theNorthern Territory will boost 2003 profit beyond previous expectations forAustralian Agricultural Company.
The cattle company predicted yesterday that its full-year result would be 10per cent below last year&apos;s $20.6 million, or about $18.5 million. AACo hadsaid earlier that the result would be between 10 and 20 per cent below theprevious year.
The forecast profit does not indicate net revenue gains from running thebusiness, because under accounting standards the company is required torevalue its cattle herd quarterly. As a result, the profit figures mainlyreflect movement in beef prices in any given period.
The first three quarters of the year have been good for the company, withtotal cattle revenue (including revaluations caused by higher beef prices)rising 14.7 per cent to $73.3 million. Total beef sales rose 27 per cent to24.3 million kilograms.
Earnings before tax and interest for the first three quarters were $21.1million, down 8 per cent on the same period last year. The company expectsthe business to be cash-flow positive for the full year.
AACo investors will receive a 2 fully franked interim dividend on May 20.
But the drought has taken its toll on results, with the higher cattlerevenue countered by increased grain costs at the group&apos;s two feedlots.Managing director Peter Holmes a Court said costs for supplementary feeding,mustering and transport of stock between properties had also increased overthe year.
However, the breeding herd increased 3 per cent compared with a nationalfall of 3 per cent this year, providing a platform for future growth.
The company had acknowledged that it was interested in the Stanbroke cattlecompany, which was being sold by AMP.
Stanbroke is Australia&apos;s biggest cattle company. AACo, with 380,000 head, 29stations and two feedlots, is second.
AACo believes the outlook for the industry is good. It predicts that cattleprices will continue to rise into the 2004 financial year. It sees continuedimprovement in the Japanese market and expects prices to remain strong inthe United States, offsetting a rising Australian dollar.
AACo believes that Asian consumption of high-quality beef will be reduced bythe SARS virus but says Korean imports are growing at 24 per cent a year.
The Aronui feedlot, bought late last year, was positively affecting results,and the company&apos;s downstream meat sales businesses were expanding.
AACo shares were down 2 yesterday to 93.

			<TEXT>Australia&apos;s third biggest cattle group, Australian Agricultural Co (AACo),has put its hand up to buy all the operations of its biggest rival, AMPLife&apos;s Stanbroke Pastoral, in a sale that is certain to shake up the northAustralian cattle industry.
AMP Henderson, as manager of Stanbroke for AMP Life, yesterday opened atender to test what it described as &quot;significant interest from a number ofparties&quot; for the prized portfolio of cattle properties.
But AMP Henderson indicated that if bids fell short of expectations it wouldcontinue to manage Stanbroke.
Stanbroke owns 27 cattle breeding and fattening stations across Queenslandand the Northern Territory, as well as beef processing operations.
AMP Henderson&apos;s head of unlisted investments, Marcus Derwin, said he wouldprefer to sell Stanbroke as a single unit rather than break up theportfolio.
Yet rural specialists believe some Queensland families may be sufficientlyflush with cash to bid for parts of Stanbroke&apos;s assets, a move that wouldstrengthen bid tension.
Industry specialists said Stanbroke might fetch as much as $500 million, butone noted that its herd numbers had dropped by 12 per cent during thedrought.
Other buyers may include the second biggest pastoral owner, S. Kidman &amp; Co,which has properties adjoining Stanbroke spreads in the Channel Country ofsouth-west Queensland, and the Packer family&apos;s Consolidated Pastoral Co,which has several stations in the northern border region of WesternAustralia and the NT.
While AACo has fewer cattle and properties than Stanbroke, which runs about500,000 cattle on 11.7 million hectares, in many ways AACo mirrors its muchbigger rival. Both run cattle breeding, fattening and finishing operations,and each has developed retail brands.
AACo&apos;s chief executive, Peter Holmes a Court, yesterday said: &quot;I would saythat we would look at the terms of the tender and be very interested in theassets as they are quality assets. It (Stanbroke) is a well-run company,with good people, good cattle.&quot;
Kidman general manager John Campbell declined to say if his company wouldbid. &quot;If we do, I can tell you it will be done very quietly,&quot; he said. Thehead of the country&apos;s fourth biggest landowner, North Australian PastoralCo&apos;s Nigel Alexander, also declined to comment.
Rural property agents believe AMP Life is selling Stanbroke when demand fortop-quality cattle properties is the strongest for two years and cattleprices are high.
John Burke, Wesfarmers Landmark&apos;s general manager in charge of ruralproperty for Queensland and the NT, said prices for Queensland cattleproperties had doubled in the past two years. &quot;Anything with hoofs and hornsgets a good price,&quot; he said. &quot;The whole demand has been around cattle.Anything with sheep, they get taken off and replaced with cattle, so sheepnumbers in Queensland are well down on where they were.&quot;
At the same time, there has been a marked reversal in the agglomerationtrend of the past 40 years, when swathes of properties were collected by afew big corporations and superannuation funds.
Mr Burke and other industry specialists noted that most of the stations thathad changed hands in recent years had been snapped up by Queensland familiessuch as the Acton and McDonald clans.
Cattle station prices normally are determined by reference to the number ofcattle on site, the average age of the herd, and livestock market prices, aswell as quality of the fencing, plant and equipment, proximity to fatteningpastures and slaughter plants.
Although Queensland and NT pastures have shrivelled during the worst droughtin a century, the owners of big cattle and sheep stations have refrainedfrom selling.
Yet there has been strong interest from potential buyers based in Indonesiaand South Africa who are in the market for individual stations.
AMP Henderson&apos;s Mr Derwin denied any link between the tender and AMP Ltd&apos;scapital position. But he declined to state if there were any prudentialissues directly related to AMP Life that might have contributed to the saledecision. ( /Text.

			<TEXT>The drought has savaged Australia&apos;s second-biggest cattle producer,Australian Agricultural Company, with net first half-year profit plummeting87 per cent to $3.7 million.
Earnings before interest and tax for the six months to December 31, 2002,fell 82 per cent to $7.1 million compared with the corresponding period in2001. However, operating cash flow fell only 26 per cent to $5.7 million.
AACo chief executive Peter Holmes a Court said that in 2002 revenuegenerated from the rising value of the company&apos;s cattle was $5 millioncompared with $43.8 million in 2001.
&quot;This was principally due to a lower cattle price appreciation in theperiod, up 4.7 per cent versus a 15.5 increase for the correspondingperiod,&quot; he said.
As at December 31 last year, AACo&apos;s 393,000 cattle herd was valued at $194.9million, reflecting an average value per head of cattle of $496. This wasslightly up on the $466 average value as at June 30 last year, but stillwell down from the $529 average as at December 31, 2001. Herd numbers fell 4per cent from 408,000 in 2001, but breeding herd numbers rose 3 per cent to191,000 and calving rates rose 2 per cent.
Mr Holmes a Court said AACo&apos;s two feedlots had helped insulate the companyfrom the worst of the drought.
AACo reiterated that full year 2003 earnings would be 10-20 per cent belowthe previous year&apos;s result of $20.6 million.
Mr Holmes a Court said the company&apos;s strong balance sheet gave it&quot;substantial acquisition capacity&quot;.
The company will open a third Polkinghornes meat outlet in Melbourne onMarch 18 in the Victoria Gardens shopping centre in Richmond.
AACo did not pay an interim dividend. AACo&apos;s shares finished 1 lower at 88.( /Text.

			<TEXT>With their &quot;paddock to plate&quot; strategy, AACo aims to serve up the finestlump of rump in the business. Philip Hopkins reports.
Australian Agricultural Company, founded in 1824, runs 400,000 cattle on 19properties in Queensland and Northern Territory. Yet the future of thepublic company, run by Peter Homes a Court, is intimately bound to two newshops that have opened in Melbourne in the past 18 months.
Polkinghornes outlets, established in the gentrified inner-city suburbs ofAlbert Park and Port Melbourne, are the new face of meat retailing.
They represent the fruits of 25 years of research into how to produce themost consistent high-quality beef and sell it to the consumer.
&quot;Polkinghornes is our laboratory, to bring the best of our beef to thepeople,&quot; said Mr Holmes a Court, AACo&apos;s chief executive. &quot;Victoria is theultimate test - it&apos;s the toughest territory for food, with the toughestcritics.&quot;
The shops were the brainchild of beef industry veteran Rod Polkinghorne, butare now majority owned by AACo, with Mr Polkinghorne retaining a minoritystake. The union was a meeting of minds.
&quot;Everybody in the meat industry knows Rod Polkinghorne. He&apos;s been a tirelessconsumer advocate for 25 years,&quot; Mr Homes a Court said.
&quot;There is another view - he upsets the applecart, annoys the status quo. Butall are aware that he will open a butcher&apos;s store and will bring meat to thepublic in the way it should be sold.&quot;
A uniting factor was both men&apos;s annoyance at how cattle farmers&apos; efforts toproduce high-quality beef were squandered when their meat was lumpedtogether with other beef in the butcher&apos;s shop.
Mr Polkinghorne summed it up. &quot;It&apos;s like taking a brand new Mercedes andthrowing the dog in the back seat,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s really deflating.&quot;
That fed a desire to control the supply chain, termed by Mr Homes a Courtthe &quot;paddock to plate&quot; strategy. A visit to the first Polkinghornes store inAlbert Park was the clincher.
&quot;It was clear he was selling and pricing meat in a nice attractiveenvironment in a way to fit the modern consumer,&quot; Mr Holmes a Court said.
&quot;It&apos;s about doing things the smart way, backed by research. If the customerwants something to be cooked in a certain way, they will be able to buy it.&quot;
Rod Polkinghorne&apos;s interest in meat science dates from 1970 when as a youngagricultural college graduate, he worked and studied in the United States onan exchange program.
There he learnt the value of feedlot farming, a necessary part ofagriculture in the harsh northern hemisphere climate where stock spend muchtime indoors.
It is a practice he has used in a targeted way in Australia, with itsgenerally high-quality natural pastures, to help produce good-quality meat.
However, frustration at declining domestic beef consumption and prices droveMr Polkinghorne to try to understand the science of beef.
&quot;People like beef when it&apos;s good, but they hate it when they get bad beef,&quot;he said. The inconsistency of beef was a key factor in pushing consumers tobuy more reliable substitutes such as chicken.
Mr Polkinghorne became a consultant to a major research project by MeatStandards Australia that aimed to analyse the factors that determined beefquality.
Over eight years, 58,000 consumers were tested with a variety of beef cuts.&quot;We worked all possible bits of the matrix - young cattle, grain-fed cattle,milk-fed, grass-fed - how the meat hangs and is cooked, whether it is agedor not,&quot; Mr Polkinghorne said.
The research included 37,000 rows of data. Meat was rated on a tendernessscale.
Out of this complex range of permutations and combinations, a model wasfinalised two years ago. Tests showed that the taste for beef in differentmarkets such as Korea and Australia was surprisingly uniform.
The research, which won an International Meat Secretariat prize in Brazil,was made available to Australian industry - but no one was interested.
&quot;We have the answer that can change the industry, but no one will buy it,&quot;Mr Polkinghorne said. &quot;Industry is its own worst enemy.&quot;
Mr Polkinghorne took the plunge himself. He bought a property at Bairnsdalein East Gippsland, where his cattle graze on quality pastures and aresupplemented with feed in poor seasons. Other selected growers are now partof the supply team, which looks after about 2000 cattle. Radfords atWarragul in West Gippsland slaughter the cattle and tender stretch the meat,while Polkinghornes has set up its own boning room in Dandenong.
The two existing shops will be supplemented by a third later this year inthe new Victoria Gardens shopping centre in the inner-city suburb ofAbbotsford.
Polkinghornes concentrates on differentiation and branding. It does not selltraditional cuts, but beef, complete with taste gradings, suitable for awhole range of uses, such as casseroles or take-home meals.
&quot;We will not sell meat that doesn&apos;t perform,&quot; Mr Polkinghorne said.
&quot;A cube for a casserole will be 21 millimetres square that will brown on allsides and won&apos;t stick to the pan, and it will be out of a muscle that&apos;s bestcooked that way.&quot;
Despite the complex science behind the product, the emphasis is on reducingbeef to simplicity. &quot;People want a meal, not an anatomy lesson,&quot; MrPolkinghorne said.
While the outlets sell free-range chicken, pork and turkey, they do not havethe absolute guarantees of the beef, where the DNA of every piece isrecorded. &quot;We can trace back even a half-chewed piece of beef to the date ofbirth of the animal,&quot; Mr Polkinghorne said.
Sales growth has been steady, with turnover doubling at the first AlbertPark stores since opening in mid-2001. &quot;The repeat walk-up traffic isgreat,&quot; Mr Polkinghorne said. &quot;Consumers are prepared to pay a little bitextra for quality.&quot;
The long-term aim is to create a series of franchises, with all the boningand preparation done at Dandenong. Mr Polkinghorne said that in the future,more of AACo&apos;s cattle from the north would be used.
Mr Holmes a Court said beef from AACo&apos;s Northern Territory properties hadwon several national taste tests.
&quot;We have no doubt we can produce high-quality beef across differentenvironments,&quot; he said.
&quot;The MSA grade system gives us the technology to sell good meat. Thesecondary factor is where it&apos;s from.&quot;
However, Mr Homes a Court was wary about making concrete predictions. &quot;Wewill not be held to targets that will place pressure on us,&quot; he said.

			<TEXT>Less than 10 months after stepping down as Australian Agricultural Company chief executive, Peter Holmes a Court has sold his big stake in the cattle giant for around $20 million.   
The sale over the past week of his remaining 7.5 per cent shareholding all but ends Mr Holmes a Court&apos;s ties with AACo, the then unfashionable company he returned from New York to head just under four years ago.   
The eldest son of late corporate raider Robert Holmes a Court, he sold his 15 million shares for up to $1.40, the highest price they have hit since the company was floated by Futuris Corporation three years ago.   
The stock has climbed from $1.34 to $1.40 since last Wednesday, when it reported a 22 per cent jump in profit to $22.2 million for the year to June 30, and forecast a similar result and stronger cash flow this year.   
It is believed the buyers were three new institutional investors: Paradice Cooper Investors, 452 Capital and Challenger Financial Services. Futuris retains 44.6 per cent of AACo and confirmed yesterday it had not lifted its stake.   
The sale came despite Mr Holmes a Court saying in January that he looked forward to continuing his support of AACo as a shareholder, and reports immediately after last week&apos;s profit announcement that he had no plans to sell, indicating he may have received offers above the then market price. -- Cathy Bolt

			<TEXT>Australia&apos;s biggest cattle owner, Australian Agricultural Company, has stuck to its predictions of 15 per cent profit growth despite a loss in the third quarter.   
AACo has also scaled back its ambitions to be a &quot;paddock-to-plate&quot; beef company with the sale of Melbourne&apos;s upmarket Polkinghorne&apos;s butcher shops.   
The company yesterday reported that earnings before interest and tax for the nine months to March 31 was $13 million, down $8 million on the previous corresponding period.   
This was due to a rise in costs offsetting higher cattle revenue and beef sales. Unaudited cattle revenue was $84 million, a rise of $10.7 million, from beef sales of 28.4 million kilograms, 4.1 million kilograms more than last year.   
The higher costs were a result of write-offs associated with the failed Stanbroke Pastoral Company tender, the exit from Polkinghorne&apos;s, the restructure and closure of the Sydney head office, and the drought.   
However, the chief executive, Don Mackay, said he expected profit after tax this year to be 15 per cent above last year&apos;s $18.3 million. AACo last year forecast a profit rise of 15-25 per cent in 2003-04. &quot;The result is dependent on current May cattle prices continuing,&quot; he said.   
The higher prices reflected the Asian bans, mainly by Japan and South Korea, of US beef due to mad cow disease in the US.   
Mr Mackay said the company&apos;s properties, all in Queensland and Northern Territory, had had a good average wet season. &quot;This has given us a generally positive outlook for the next 12 to 18 months,&quot; he said.   
Mr Mackay said AACo had originally bought into Polkinghorne&apos;s to research the retailing of high-quality beef. He said that positive things had been learnt and would be applied in the company&apos;s business.   
&quot;In retail, there is some potential for the concept of selling excellent beef, but we are not the ones to do that,&quot; he said.   
Mr Mackay said the Polkinghorne&apos;s store in Victoria Gardens in Richmond had been a disaster and was sold.   
The Port Melbourne store had been retained as Meat by the Bay, while the original Polkinghorne&apos;s store in Albert Park had reverted to the ownership of Ric Polkinghorne.   
Mr Mackay said the flagship 1824 beef brand was still being developed and was available in 70 hotels in eastern Australia. A seventh Jesters Pies store had also opened in Melbourne.   
AACo is reverting to its previous one dividend payment for 2004. Mr Mackay said the annual dividend, expected to be 6 &#194;&#162; a share would be paid in early October. AACo&apos;s shares finished 2 &#194;&#162; higher at $1.20.

			<TEXT>AACo is one of Australia&apos;s biggest beef producers and landowners, with 450,000 cattle on 21 properties across northern Australia. Leonie Wood asks ABN Amro Morgans director Sophie Mitchell how the company is faring.   
Q Australian Agricultural Co has reported a 27 per cent jump in first-half revenues to $55 million, as average cattle prices rose. But a multiplicity of issues affect its performance - concerns overseas about &quot;mad cow&quot; disease, higher tariffs on beef imported into Japan and the rise of the Australian dollar. How do you see the outlook for AACo?   
A The outlook is very positive. Seasonal conditions have improved substantially across most of their properties. It has been a fairly average to above-average wet season in northern Australia, and so properties that have been suffering from drought for the past few years have had a great start to the season. As well, the Australian beef industry is benefiting from the &quot;mad cow&quot; disease issue and higher demand for Australian beef in Asian markets, such as Japan. Japan demand has increased because North America, in particular, is blocked from selling beef to key Asian markets. So there is very strong demand in Japan for beef that has been grown out of the feedlot, and AACo operates two feedlots so they have been able to benefit from that. The whole combination has created higher beef prices, that are probably offsetting the impact of the higher Australian dollar.   
Q Do the increases in Japan&apos;s tariffs, however, at all affect the demand for beef in that market?   
A There has been a huge boost in the demand for Australian beef into Japan because North America has been shut out of those markets. So yes, you may have seen tariff increases, but if you are going to be consuming beef in those markets at the moment, there are only a few markets that they can access beef from, and Australia is one of them.   
Q How long is that increased demand expected to last?   
A I think it will increase our share of those markets, though it will return back to normal at some point. But hopefully, Australian producers will have a greater share.   
Q What are the risks for AACo at the moment? If we have fantastic pastoral conditions with the drought ending, great fattening conditions on the east coast of Queensland, what are the dangers?   
A The dangers would be any massive downturn in demand for its products, be it domestically or export. Australia is well known for &quot;clean&quot; beef production, and an outbreak of BSE (bovine spongiform encephalitis) in Australia would be devastating but I would say the possibility is pretty slim.   
Q Peter Holmes a Court recently resigned as chief executive, handing the role to his No. 2 Don Mackay at the same time as the company consolidated its operational headquarters in Brisbane. Did the managerial change cause you any concern?   
A I don&apos;t think so, but perhaps some people wonder whether Holmes a Court&apos;s 8 per cent shareholding may become available. Don Mackay and his team were already running the big part of the business, the cattle production, so that just keeps on going. From a practical sense the change made no major impact on the company.   
Q What would you like to see AACo do in terms of growth?   
A I think it is an extremely well run operation. In its beef production process, there are probably some areas where if they could get extra access to land that would benefit it. There&apos;s some property infilling they could do to grow the business. But I think the strategy they are on at the moment is a fairly solid one, and is deliverable.   
Q Did AACo&apos;s failure to buy Stanbroke last year inhibit its growth?   
A It would have been a company-changing transaction. AACo is the second-largest cattle producer to the Stanbroke group, so it still has relative economies of scale advantages compared to most of the rest of the Australian industry. If it had bought Stanbroke, it would have been such a dominant leading player instead of just one of the few leading groups.   
Q Is it the kind of stock you would consider a growth stock? I noticed you upgraded your target share price by 10 &#194;&#162; to $1.40 after the half-year results.   
A AACo is for growth in the medium term. It is a steady growth story. I think the bigger short-term story is that it is trading at a fairly substantial discount to its NTA (net tangible assets) backing of $1.57. I would expect if you looked at the market value today, it is understated. If anything, it is a fantastic rural property play.   
Q Does that make it a takeover target? Is that what you are suggesting?   
A Well, it&apos;s got a shareholder with 42 per cent (Futuris Corp). So unless Futuris is willing to sell, it is hard to see it as a takeover target.   
Q We have seen the Australian dollar rise by one-third over the past year. If it were to come off, say, 15 per cent, how would that affect AACo?   
A It would be beneficial, because obviously their export markets would improve, and the majority of their beef ends up in export markets even though they are not directly selling into it.

			<TEXT>Sydney -- Peter Holmes a Court may no longer be in charge of the Australian Agricultural Co cattle empire, but do not expect hostilities with old enemy AMP to abate.   
Mr Holmes a Court, who stood down as AACo chief executive last week after the bovine concern decided to move its head office from Sydney to Brisbane, had been preparing a damages claim against AMP reportedly worth $100 million.   
The claim is for compensation after AMP Life&apos;s Stanbroke Pastoral Company was sold for $417.5 million to Nebo Holdings, a group of rural families including hamburger king &quot;Hungry&quot; Jack Cowin.   
Although Mr Holmes a Court played a hands-on role in a previous legal skirmish with AMP, attending court each day, AACo chairman Nick Burton Taylor said the resignation would not quell any future legal activities.   
&quot;It wasn&apos;t a personal thing, it was a company thing,&quot; he said. &quot;The thing is on foot, it continues&quot;.   
AACo tried, and failed, to block the sale in the Federal Court in October, claiming AACo&apos;s higher offer was ignored because it planned to merge its cattle operations with those of Stanbroke rather than operate Stanbroke&apos;s 27-cattle stations as a stand-alone company.   
Immediately after Justice Ronald Sackville found no ground to stop the sale to Nebo, Mr Holmes a Court confirmed a damages claim was in the works.   
An AACo damages claim is expected to involve about $2 million costs associated with its bid, plus the loss of future profits that could be up to $100 million.   
Potential legal action is not the only connection AACo has to Nebo.   
Mr Burton Taylor said AACo&apos;s board, which now includes Mr Holmes a Court as a non-executive director, was closely following reports that Mr Cowin was considering whether to quit his Stanbroke stake.   
&quot;The whole (beef) industry is transfixed with what is happening at Nebo, some with mixed emotions,&quot; he said. &quot;The industry looks headed for a reconsolidation and there may be some opportunities for us&quot;.   
If Mr Cowin, who is believed to be caught in the middle of a dispute involving some of Nebo&apos;s other backers, were to sell his 25 per cent stake, it could lead to a break up of the 11.5 million hectare pastoral business based in Queensland and the NT.   
Nebo has already sold three Queensland leases for $49 million with another for sale. Meanwhile, AACo is working on the results of a strategic review, which began soon after it missed out on Stanbroke.   
Given the limited opportunities to buy large tracts of land after the Stanbroke sale, Mr Burton Taylor said the group was following &quot;a back-to-basics philosophy&quot; based on a &quot;very ambitious internal capital expenditure program&quot;.   
&quot;Up to now, with land prices, it&apos;s been cheaper to buy land than fully develop what you have,&quot; he said. &quot;The strategy now is to focus on our strengths such as strong brands and operations which are very integrated&quot;. The strategy included such things as &quot;better feed utilisation&quot;.   
AACo shares fell 3 &#194;&#162; to $1.24. AMP was 3 &#194;&#162; weaker at $4.91.

			<TEXT>Australia&apos;s beef industry is in a state of flux. Shareholders in Australian Agricultural Company would have been shocked at the news that Peter Holmes a Court quit as chief executive of the company on Friday.   
AACo announced it was moving its head office from Sydney to Brisbane, and Mr Holmes a Court said he did not want to make the move with his young family. Executive director of operations Don Mckay will take over as CEO and analysts will be watching market reaction today as shareholders digest AACo&apos;s news.   
Meanwhile, Hungry Jack&apos;s Jack Cowin must decide whether to sell his 25 per cent stake in Stanbroke, Australia&apos;s largest cattle company, or remain in the hope that he can persuade his new partners to settle down and get on with the job at hand.   
Selling would appear Mr Cowin&apos;s most attractive option but it might lead to a break-up of the $500 million pastoral business that spans 11.5 million hectares of Queensland and the Northern Territory and revive the intentions of AACo to be the beef industry&apos;s undisputed leader.   
The partners, led by Swan Hill agriculturalist Peter Menegazzo, bought the 27 pastoral leases from AMP Henderson Global Investors in September after first out-manoeuvring Mr Holmes a Court, when he ran AACo, during the tender process and then surviving a legal challenge from him in the Federal Court.   
The ink was barely dry when the ever-active bush telegraph across northern Australia was buzzing with stories of a disagreement between Mr Menegazzo, who owns half the purchase vehicle Nebo Holdings and Investment Company, and a faction of four families of North Queensland pastoralists who hold the remaining 25 per cent.   
Mr Menegazzo and his son Mark occupy two of the four board seats and hold the casting vote. They have built an empire of farm properties across Australia on prudent management and insisted on carving out four of the less profitable leases for sale to plug a $74 million hole in their financing arrangements.   
The Nebo consortium had paid $417.5 million cash and had to settle $72.5 million of Stanbroke&apos;s leftover debts. The Nebo partners had put in $16 million and financed the remainder of the cash purchase with a $400 million loan from the Dutch-controlled Rabo Bank.   
The four families led by Peter Hughes, an original Stanbroke director who created the consortium when AMP put the business up for sale, were opposed to splitting any of the properties. They believed the $74 million gap could be easily covered in other ways.   
A source close to the families said they saw the deal through cattlemen&apos;s eyes. They had acquired 500,000 head of cattle for $500 million; at $1000 a head plus the land they grazed, it was a bargain worth double or even triple the price and $74 million would not be a problem.   
Stanbroke has since sold three of the Queensland leases for $49 million but Havilah, a property near Collinsville, in central Queensland, failed to sell and the consortium has dropped the price from $36 million to $27 million. It is still enough to plug the financial hole but the consortium is no longer hopeful of a quick sale.   
Mr Cowin, whose net worth was put at $353 million in last year&apos;s Business Review Weekly Rich List, found himself caught in the middle. He was the last to join the consortium, having agreed to invest $4 million because he believed it would give him a toehold on the supply line of his business&apos;s most important ingredient.   
He held no firm thoughts on the carve-up but he has strong opinions about business partners who disagree over fundamentals.   
As well, he has no stomach for disputes among former partners, having been involved in a fight in the High Court with Hungry Jack&apos;s US parent company Burger King, which tried to terminate a long-standing agreement.   
He received $71 million from the action and, having since reached an arrangement with Burger King, Mr Cowin is anxious to concentrate on a $150 million expansion that will give him 400 Hungry Jack&apos;s outlets to help him challenge McDonald&apos;s in Australia.   
He is no longer so convinced that a minority interest in live cattle will lead to any vertical integration or will bear any other business relationship with the hamburger supply chain.   
A spokesman for his company, Competitive Foods, said this week that until Mr Cowin returned to Australia there would be no comment about Stanbroke. Mr Menegazzo and Mr Hughes did not return calls while a member of the other families, who asked not to be named, confirmed that their opposition to the carve-up had been overruled by a majority decision.   
AACo, meanwhile, has been adding to its ever-growing northern pastoral empire.   
Last week it announced it had paid $50 million for the 50,000-hectare Carrum Station near Julia Creek Queensland, and 58,000 head of cattle. This brings the number of leases to 21.   
The company has also reached an agistment arrangement with the giant Lawn Hill Station near the Gulf of Carpentaria, which will allow it to increase its breeding herd by 19 per cent and lift calf production to 135,000 head a year.   
After the Nebo consortium acquired Stanbroke, it is believed Mr Holmes a Court - when he ran AACo - offered them an additional $40 million, which may still be on the table.

			<TEXT>Australia&apos;s second-biggest beef producer, Australian Agricultural Co, has spent $50 million to buy 58,000 head of cattle and a Queensland property as part of its expansion drive.   
The acquisition will boost AACo&apos;s breeding herd by 19 per cent to 190,000 breeding females and bring its total herd to about 460,000 head.   
It is also expected to generate extra operating cash flow, before interest and tax, of $4.5 million in its first full year of operation. The $50 million deal will be funded by term debt.   
AACo shares rose 4 &#194;&#162;, or 3.28 per cent, yesterday to $1.26.   
The acquired property is Carrum Station (50,613 hectares). It has a carrying capacity of about 8000 cattle and adjoins the road and rail links at Julia Creek in north-west Queensland.   
The 58,000 cattle, a Brahman and Brahman-cross breeding herd, will be run on Carrum Station, AACo&apos;s existing properties and Lawn Hill Station under an agistment arrangement.   
Lawn Hill, a 467,045-hectare property near the Gulf of Carpentaria, can carry 40,000 cattle. It will run under the agistment deal as a breeding station and adjoins AACo&apos;s Gregory Downs Station.   
Carrum will take young cattle from AACo properties in the Barkly Tableland to grow until they reach feedlot entry weight. They will then enter either of AACo&apos;s two feedlots at Goonoo and Aronui in central and south Queensland respectively.   
The expanded breeding herd will lift calf production from 115,000 to about 135,000 a year.   
AACo&apos;s chief executive, Peter Holmes a Court, said Carrum would improve the company&apos;s production system.   
&quot;By taking more young cattle off AACo&apos;s breeding stations and growing them on Carrum, the breeding stations will be able to carry more breeding cows, which will result in more calves produced,&quot; he said. &quot;It will also shorten the time required to bring young cattle to market.&quot;   
Mr Holmes a Court said efficiency gains would be worth $1 million a year in two years.   
AACo&apos;s shares have risen substantially in the past two weeks since the US reported its first suspected case of mad cow disease. AACo, a big beef exporter, is expected to pick up any slack as US beef exports are hit.   
The new acquisition also eases disappointment from AACo&apos;s failure last year to buy AMP&apos;s Stanbroke cattle property, which was sold for $490 million to Nebo Holdings, a syndicate of Queensland families.   
AACo posted a net profit of $18.3 million for 2002-03, down from $20.6 million the previous year but in line with market expectations. It expects net profit to rise 15-25 per cent in 2003-04, thanks to greater sales of cattle and higher prices.

			<TEXT>TRADING ROOM  
CATTLE giant Australian Agricultural Company is tipping a strong profit this year provided good rains continue and beef prices remain high.  
Chief executive Don Mackay said the late June rain would assist recovery in the second half of the year. &quot;If cattle prices remain at present levels . . . we should meet market expectations on profit,&quot; he said yesterday.  
He declined to nominate a profit figure, but some analysts have tipped a full-year profit of about $28 million. First-half profit was $6.7 million, a 51 per cent rise on the December half.  
AACo&apos;s financial year now ends on December 31; this is the end of its main sales and operating cycle and better reflects the seasonal nature of its business.  
Mr Mackay said world demand for beef remained strong, but demand could fluctuate because of high prices. However, the world supply of quality beef remained limited.  
&quot;We will strive to satisfy customer demand for traceable, quality-assured and source-verified products,&quot; he said.  
Mr Mackay said forward purchases of grain ensured that feed costs would remain at low levels for the rest of the year.  
AACo&apos;s budget for this year is based on the $A staying in a range of US74 &#194;&#162;-78 &#194;&#162;.  
Mr Mackay said the US would struggle to re-enter the Japanese market. US domestic demand was strong, so US producers would concentrate on that.  
Also, the US did not have the traceability and age verification systems that Australia had. This would make it hard for the US to meet the strict age and slaughter conditions that Japan had put on it to resume beef trade. &quot;That will restrict their capacity to compete with us.&quot; He said US beef sales to Japan would probably resume after Christmas.  
Mr Mackay said Canada was an emerging threat to Australia&apos;s North Asian markets. It was putting in place similar quality-assurance measures to Australia, but was also likely to focus much of its efforts on the US market.  
AACo&apos;s revenue rose 7 per cent to $85.6 million in the June half, when rainfall was 31 per cent down on the average.  
Only good December and June rains had got the company through the tough dry spell, Mr Mackay said. AACo bought 5000 fewer cattle and held back 15,000 head from sale because of the lower prices earlier in the year.  
The company declared a dividend of 7 &#194;&#162; a share, 17 per cent up on last year, franked to 20 per cent. It will be paid on October 14 for shareholders registered on September 22. AACo shares closed at $1.78, up 1.5 &#194;&#162;.

			<TEXT>ON THE LAND  
US BEEF export woes will ensure continuing boom conditions for Australian exports to Japan, but will cut access to the US under the free trade agreement, an analyst report has concluded.  
Management and investment group Rural Management Partners said the US was likely to resume beef exports to Japan and Korea this year.  
US beef exports were banned in these countries in December 2003 after the discovery of BSE (mad cow disease), and Australia filled the gap. The US had 20 per cent of international beef exports from 2000-03, but this dropped to 3 per cent last year.  
However, the US Department of Agriculture did not think exports would reach pre-2003 levels in the next 10 years, said RMP, a subsidiary of Australian Agricultural Company, in its latest rural outlook.  
&quot;US producers are not very motivated to meet the stringent regulations set by Japan and Korea when high prices can be achieved at home,&quot; said RMP managing director Chris Evans.  
&quot;With the US playing a lesser role . . . strong demand from Japan for Australian beef is likely to continue until at least 2010.&quot;  
Australia&apos;s beef exports to Japan reached $2 billion last year, 49 per cent of Australia&apos;s $4.2 billion of beef exports.  
The high domestic US prices have been driven by home demand, with producers holding back cows for herd rebuilding.  
Mr Evans said per capita consumption of beef in the US was 42.7 kilograms last year - 11 per cent higher than Australia - and was expected to grow.  
&quot;This strong domestic demand is not being met by its own production and the US is expected to remain a net importer of beef for the next 10 years,&quot; he said. Prices would remain high until 2007 when the herd rebuild would ease supply.  
However, Mr Evans said this situation could also cut Australian access to the US. The FTA with the US stated that the additional beef quota of 15,000 tonnes would only be granted if US beef exports returned to their pre-BSE levels.  
Australia, with about 20 per cent of world beef exports, faced new threats from Brazil, the world&apos;s largest beef supplier by volume, and Argentina, he said.  
Favourable exchange rates would make them more competitive, at least at the lower end of the market.

			<TEXT>CATTLE families have stolen a march under the noses of corporations as the movers and shakers in Australia&apos;s surging beef industry.  
Family companies now make up 55 per cent of the land-holdings of the top 10 per cent of beef producers, according to Rural Management Partners, a management and investment company owned by Australian Agricultural Company.  
RMP managing director Chris Evans said nearly 30 families had vaulted themselves into the ranks of large-scale cattle producers with the sale and dispersal of AMP&apos;s Stanbroke Pastoral Co.  
Of the 19 Stanbroke properties sold last year, 18 were bought by family companies. &quot;We&apos;ve seen 10 or more families pursuing cattle properties for values of between $20 and $50 million. This has never happened before,&quot; Mr Evans said.  
He said that collectively, the families owned more than 30 million hectares of land in Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland.  
Five families were in the top 10 beef cattle producers and were competing with corporate giants such as AACo, Stanbroke and NAPCO.  
&quot;Some families have aggregated properties capable of running 100,000 or 150,000 head of cattle, representing businesses of more than $150 million.&quot;  
Mr Evans, speaking on the launch of RMP&apos;s beef industry outlook study, said the large family businesses were run along corporate lines, achieving economies of scale by spreading overheads.  
With widely spread properties, Mr Evans said they were well-placed to cope with drought, and could implement integrated beef production systems. Many had feedlots and some were marketing their own beef products to retailers.  
The report highlights widespread structural change in the beef cattle industry. About three-quarters of all beef farms have an estimated value of agricultural operations (EVAO) of less than $200,000, and hold 30 per cent of the total herd.  
However, 3 per cent of properties with cattle have 32 per cent of the total herd and an EVAO of more than $1 million.  
Mr Evans said many landowners also now leased their land. Recent deals had involved consolidating adjoining properties to achieve relatively large leases that were attractive to operators wanting integrated beef production, he said.

			<TEXT>HIGH world beef prices, increased productivity and better weather have helped almost to triple the annual profit of cattle giant Australian Agricultural Company.  
For the 12 months to December 31, AACo&apos;s net profit after tax was $31.3 million, up $19.7 million on the previous 12 months.  
AACo received permission in December from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to change its balance date from June 30 to December 31 to better reflect its core activities. Big cash flows occur during the selling cycle from March to August.  
Operating revenue last year was $183.2 million, 41.5 per cent higher than the $128.7 million in 2003.  
Chief executive Don Mackay said weather patterns last year after the drought were closer to normal in most of AACo&apos;s regions in Queensland and the Northern Territory.  
&quot;This allowed the company to continue to capitalise on its long-term strategy of herd growth and breed development,&quot; he said.  
Herd numbers were 524,000 at December 31 compared with 395,000 in 2003. Cattle sales last year were 175,725 compared with 135,892 the year before. A total of 45.3 million kilograms of beef was sold compared with 35.4 million kilograms in 2003.  
AACo&apos;s land and buildings were revalued by an extra $53.7 million last year.  
Mr Mackay said the flagship brand &quot;1824&quot;, which now includes Wagyu beef, had increased package sales to Asia. AACo was also working with Coles Myer to promote 1824 in supermarkets.  
Mr Mackay said world supply of clean quality beef was still restricted, with herds in Australia and the US still low. Demand was growing in Asia and the US. &quot;This has delivered significant improvement in prices for Australian beef,&quot; he said.  
The shares rose 1 &#194;&#162; to $1.86.

			<TEXT>THE impact of drought will ripple across Australia&apos;s farms, influencing growth in gross domestic product and exposing several agriculture-focused companies, says a Goldman Sachs JBWere report.  
The report, put together by the economics and emerging companies teams, says the Australian Agricultural Company (AAco), Futuris Corp, Incitec Pivot and Nufarm are most sensitive to drought, with cattle producer AAco likely to be the hardest hit.  
AAco operates 24 cattle stations in Queensland and the Northern Territory and two feedlots, and although the company has access to water, it is likely to be affected by falling beef prices.  
The analysts say the fall in domestic beef prices will reduce earnings by about 11 per cent in calendar 2007. &quot;Droughts can lead to excessive destocking of cattle, which would see prices fall further,&quot; they say.  
Taking Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics predictions of a 36 per cent drop in winter crop production into account, the report suggests GDP growth may be shackled by the farm sector.  
&quot;Our 3.6 per cent growth forecast for 2006-07 already incorporates significant drag from the farm sector equivalent to 0.6 per cent subtraction from GDP for that year,&quot; the report says.  
&quot;Given the deterioration in conditions subsequently and more dire predictions from some private sector forecasters, the risks to our forecast remain on the downside.&quot;  
The Drought: Economic impact and stock-specific risks report says Futuris, which has an interest in Elders and AAco, may be affected by the drought&apos;s flow-on effects as farmers and other rural dwellers cut spending.  
It assesses the drought-sensitivity of Incitec Pivot and Nufarm as medium, saying sales and profit will be affected when farmers decide to plant fewer crops, requiring less fertiliser or crop protection products.  
The report also identifies Bendigo Bank, McGuigan Simeon Wines, Select Harvests and Timbercorp as sensitive to drought, although it labels their risk as low.  
With just 2.5 per cent of Australia&apos;s economic output coming from the agricultural sector, the economy is less affected by drought and downturns than it used to be.  
However, because agricultural outputs rise and fall sharply, it is still significant and has a knock-on effect.  
&quot;In the event of a prolonged drought, we see a widespread secondary impact throughout the economy, including the retail sector,&quot; the report says.

			<TEXT>Overseas interest will challenge government and its handling of the rural company&apos;s sale.   
LES Wozniczka&apos;s decision to put  Futuris Corp&apos;s $300 million-plus 43 per cent stake in  Australian Agricultural Co on the block is a googly for AAco, and, possibly, for the Federal Government.   
On one level, AAco will be pleased to see the back of Futuris, which spun off AAco in 2001. The Perth-based group&apos;s presence on the cattle company&apos;s share register has maintained a choke on the supply of shares available to active institutional traders, and handed Futuris an effective power of veto over equity-funded expansion.   
But the move also potentially unsettles AAco because the Futuris CEO&apos;s preferred exit route will not be one AAco itself would choose.   
The cattle company got a heads-up from Futuris that the sale decision was about to be announced, but wasn&apos;t consulted about it, possibly because its own interests are best served by a distribution of the shares to the market, to open up its register, reinstate a takeover premium, and expand its equity capital market options.   
But Wozniczka&apos;s aim is to get the best outcome for his shareholders, not AAco&apos;s. And he can do that by locating a single buyer willing to pay a premium for the effective control the 43 per cent stake delivers. A block sale should in turn force a bid for the entire company, so in that sense Futuris has put AAco into play, with all the attendant complications.   
Citigroup has been chosen by Futuris to examine sale options, in league, as is often the case these days, with a boutique adviser, Caliburn. There are potential Australian buyers: but if the search leads to an overseas-based group, the sell-off will also have political undertones for the Government next year, be it a renewed Howard Government, or a newly elected Labor government. There&apos;s nothing in Australia&apos;s official open-door foreign investment stance to suggest that should be the case, of course.   
But AAco runs more than 500,000 cattle across the top end of Australia, on 24 properties that cover no less than 7 million hectares. That&apos;s about 1.2 per cent of Australia&apos;s land mass: if there is an iconic rural asset in this country, the 183-year-old AAco is it.   
Wozniczka indicated yesterday that Futuris was essentially looking to crystallise profits from a buy and hold strategy, taking a capital gain on an asset that is generating a low earnings yield on profits that slipped from $16.1 million to $5.6 million in calendar 2006, and $5.9 million in the June half this year. The cattle company may actually post a small loss for the full year as it continues to build cattle numbers, but as CSFB analyst Andrew Butterell noted in a recent report, AAco is an asset play, not an earnings one, and it is on that basis it will be sold and bought. A sale in the first half of next year would also be well timed for Futuris, because its own rural services profits are being pressured by the drought that continues to grip southern Australia.   
Futuris spun AAco out as a separate listed company in August 2001 after lowering the sale price to attract investors, and AAco underperformed as a listed company initially, dipping below its $1-a-share float price and not regaining it until mid-2002.   
But this year its shares have risen from $1.83 in mid-January to a high of $3.34 on August 2, before sliding back down to a low of $2.50 in mid-August as the entire market sank, and to $2.50 again this month, as investors factored in lower beef prices and a return to more competitive conditions in East Asian markets.   
AAco itself has seen good rainfall across its north Australian properties, which are geared to the annual monsoon season, and cattle prices in the north have held up. But prices in the south have fallen by almost 20 per cent since June, as cattle are sold to reduce numbers before what is likely to be a drought-affected summer, and, as Australian beef exports to East Asia face growing competition from South America, the US and Canada, which were locked out of East Asia for three years after a bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease) scare.   
The possibility that Futuris could sell the stake in one hit at a premium and trigger a bid for the balance was reflected in the market yesterday, with AAco&apos;s shares rising 30&#194;&#162;, or 12 per cent, to $2.80, valuing the entire company at $718 million and Futuris&apos; stake at $309 million. Futuris&apos; shares rose by 11.5&#194;&#162;, or almost 6 per cent, to $2.10.   
AAco is already trading at a healthy premium to its net tangible assets of $2.38 a share, and its price could go higher if the sale announcement flushes out interest here and overseas.   
Possible buyers here include  Macquarie Bank&apos;s new pastoral fund, which is planning to eventually run a $1 billion rural property portfolio, and there is a precedent for a consortium offer in the AMP&apos;s $490 million sale of its Stanbroke Pastoral company to an investor group that included Hungry Jacks&apos; founder, Jack Cowin, in 2003. Stanbroke was profitably broken up the following year. AAco was the unsuccessful high bidder in AMP&apos;s 2003 sale, and launched legal action that resulted in a $10 million settlement payment by AMP.   
The Packer family has also been a big player, with its 5 million hectare Consolidated Pastoral operation, but with James Packer now focusing squarely on the global casino industry, its long-term commitment to the industry is uncertain.   
Overseas interest in AAco cannot be discounted, with Asian groups including Singapore&apos;s  Temasek Holdings a possible buyer, on the strategic grounds that AAco is positioned as a long-term supplier to the Asian economic boom.

			<TEXT>Contented cattle are the key to Rod Polkinghorne&apos;s continued success, writes Philip Hopkins.   
ROD Polkinghorne still bears the scars from his partnership with big listed cattle group Australian Agricultural Company.   
The split between the two was acrimonious, almost sending Mr Polkinghorne to the wall. But his family business, centred on the retail meat store in bayside Albert Park, survived.   
What also survived was the &quot;paddock to plate&quot; philosophy that inspired the original partnership: controlling beef quality, from nurturing the cattle to the point of sale to the consumer. Mr Polkinghorne&apos;s family company has now taken up the fight to put the business model into effect. &quot;I&apos;m pretty stubborn,&quot; he said.   
This approach is based on the science of beef after years of research by Meat Standards Australia that shows the taste for beef in different markets is surprisingly uniform.   
Surveys of 58,000 consumers, eating a variety of beef cuts, have given Mr Polkinghorne a good idea of what it takes to consistently produce good-quality beef.   
Getting it right from the start is crucial - hence Mr Polkinghorne&apos;s acquisition a decade ago of a cattle property near Bairnsdale, in East Gippsland. The property is in good condition after recent rain.   
&quot;Gippsland tends to be green and hilly, the cattle run on grass ... the region looks like the image,&quot; Mr Polkinghorne said. A few other selected, passionate producers from Gippsland are also part of the supply team.   
Mr Polkinghorne&apos;s 445-hectare property has 500 breeding cattle. He supervises a complex breeding program involving Angus, Hereford and shorthorn breeds.   
Genetics are important. &quot;The number of muscle fibres can determine meat quality in a calf not even born,&quot; he said.   
The cattle graze on the high-quality pasture - &quot;we follow dairy techniques, they&apos;re good at pasture management&quot; - with feed and irrigation as back-up during drought.   
Mr Polkinghorne does not care for whip-cracking, &quot;man from Snowy River&quot;-like antics. That just creates stress in the cattle. The emphasis is more on creating a comfortable environment so the cattle are happier and more productive.   
&quot;We do like the cattle, we want to honour the animal, it&apos;s a sacrifice to part with them,&quot; Mr Polkinghorne said. &quot;We want them to have a good life. You get sentimental - that&apos;s the business we&apos;re in. They have no premonition, no fear of death. The end is humane and quiet.&quot;   
Mr Polkinghorne said the most critical time in the process was the start of the final muster on the farm, to the point when the cattle hit rigor mortis in the abattoir, about six to eight hours after death. &quot;It can start on the farm with a lousy set of yards, with a whip and noise,&quot; he said.   
&quot;The cattle get spooked. Too often they&apos;re taken to the abattoir in a dirty, crowded truck that travels too fast.   
&quot;If they stop eating, they start to lose weight, and carcase and tissue strength. Stress creates dehydration, less moisture in the muscle and less carcase weight.&quot;   
In 24 hours, cattle can lose 5 per cent of their weight, sometimes turning high-quality beef into hamburger meat. Stress can also tighten muscle fibres, affecting meat quality.   
Mr Polkinghorne takes about 20 head of cattle on Sunday nights to Radfords abattoir in Warragul, a two-hour, unstressful drive. &quot;They know what we want,&quot; he said.   
&quot;We arrive at night so the cattle are not standing around. Radfords has undercover pens with soft floors, fresh water and fresh hay. If it rains, the cattle are still dry, and very comforted and rested.&quot;   
The Polkinghorne cattle are the first killed in the morning. Radfords monitors the kill and ear tag number, which Polkinghornes correlates with the carcase number to ensure traceability.   
The dead cattle are then taken to Polkinghornes&apos; new industrial kitchen at Somerville, on the Mornington Peninsula. There, a crucial stage in the beef revolution takes place: the meat is cut according to quality, not traditional cuts, because the business sells its beef with a star rating.   
&quot;We grade and cut 45 muscles in each beast,&quot; Mr Polkinghorne said. &quot;For example, there are four muscles in a rump and they all eat differently. We separate them all.&quot; It is a similar story with T-bone steak, which has a small, tender fillet and a different quality meat. &quot;We try and sell the result, not just a bit of meat.&quot;   
The meat is then taken to the shop in Albert Park. Mr Polkinghorne is happy with the shop&apos;s progress, which has been a lifesaver.   
Annual growth has averaged 15 per cent week-on-week since the shop opened in 2001. The total Polkinghorne business has a turnover of about $3 million.   
Expansion is the aim. Franchising is one option, as there is a lot of capacity in the Somerville plant.   
&quot;There is a limit to what two farmers can do,&quot; Mr Polkinghorne said. &quot;We&apos;ve stood the test of six tough years. It&apos;s gone from &apos;you&apos;re mad&apos;, to grudging acknowledgement of success. The tide is turning ... but there is a need for capital.&quot;

			<TEXT>THE nation&apos;s biggest beef producer, Australian Agricultural Company, has positioned itself for carbon trading and developing high-value agriculture in Australia&apos;s north.   
In the interim, the company&apos;s outlook is positive due to a generally good wet season and strong world demand for beef.   
Chief executive Don Mackay, speaking at the annual meeting in Brisbane, said worries about water in the Murray-Darling Basin had heightened interest in northern Australia. A more varied, robust and productive agricultural region could be developed there.   
&quot;AAco&apos;s strong foothold in areas of reliable rainfall, high run-off and quality soil types should become an increasingly valuable asset,&quot; he said.   
Mr Mackay said the company was committed to biological, not chemical, solutions for environmental problems. &quot;At Carrum Station, for example, we have introduced a goat herd to control the invasive weed prickly acacia,&quot; he said.   
Mr Mackay said there needed to be changes to regulations for northern agricultural development, particularly restrictions on pastoral leases.   
Chairman Nick Burton Taylor said AAco could benefit from the emerging carbon market by developing carbon abatement projects, or &quot;carbon sinks&quot;.   
&quot;It is unfortunate that Federal Government policy has precluded the agricultural sector as an active participant in the development of carbon trading policies,&quot; he said. &quot;It is one of our management tasks to construct a mechanism for AAco to enter this emerging and exciting market sector.&quot;   
Mr Mackay said the company&apos;s northern stations were in fine condition after a good wet season. Further south, conditions were more uncertain despite some good rain. &quot;Along with a higher $A, this has led to price falls in a number of market categories,&quot; he said.   
But Mr Mackay said international demand for beef was strong, although the return of US beef to Korea was a threat.   
&quot;Offsetting this ... is continued demand for quality beef in Korea, which has remained unsatisfied from limited Australian exports,&quot; he said.   
&quot;AAco&apos;s largest customer in Korea, the large Emart Hypermarket chain, has recently visited our operations and confirmed their commitment to selling AAco beef in their 106 stores.&quot;   
AAco&apos;s shares yesterday closed 4&#194;&#162; lower at $2.56.

			<TEXT>IN A bid to shore up its dwindling share price, Australian Agricultural Company has unveiled a $250 million deal to sell five of its properties into a joint venture.
The news kicked AAco shares above $2 for the first time since last month, but they failed to hold there, closing at $1.825 for a respectable 14.5 gain on the day.
AAco chief executive Stephen Toms said the company had had &quot;a big disconnect&quot; between the high prices at which properties were traded in rural real estate markets and its sharemarket valuation.
AAco has 26 properties, valued on its books at $800 million, and 600,000 head of cattle, worth about $400 million, against $400million of debt, yet its market capitalisation is less than $500 million.
AAco is hoping the heads of agreement signed with specialist rural investor Primary Holdings International will produce a re-rating of its shares.
Also hoping for the re-rating is Futuris Corporation chief executive Malcolm Jackman who has his group&apos;s 43 per cent stake in AAco on the market.
Mr Jackman said yesterday that Futuris, which before he took over forced a wholesale change in AAco&apos;s board this year, was supportive of Mr Toms&apos; plan.
He said Futuris had not been told which five properties were being sold into the joint venture with Primary Holdings. It is believed they are the abutting runs north-east of Mount Isa in Queensland - Wondoola, Canobie, Kalmeta, Dalgonally and Clonagh.
AAco said once the deal was completed, it was likely to use the money for debt retirement and a share buyback.
First news a deal was in the offing emerged late last week, and AAco shares leapt on Thursday to above $1.80, but were sold down all day as investors took profits.
Primary Holdings, which is run by two sets of brothers in Australia - Bob and James Tucker and Angus and Bryce Graham - was set up as a specialist rural investor about a year ago.

			<TEXT>FUTURIS CORPFULL-YEAR RESULTSNet profit: 	$36.4m 	t- 65%Revenue: 	$3.3bn 	+s 3%Dividend: 		5.5	 (total 9.5)DIVIDEND PAYMENT DATE: OCTOBER 28
AGRIBUSINESS group Futuris Corp has signalled it still wants to sell non-core assets like beef producer Australian Agricultural Company after its 2007-08 profit slumped by two-thirds.
Chairman Stephen Gerlach said the results were disappointing, but the board was intent on realising the potential in the core businesses. &quot;We expect to advance our strategy during the current year through realisation of capital from non-core assets,&quot; he said.
Futuris posted a profit of $36.4 million, a fall of 65% from $105.4 million the previous year, due to a range of non-recurring items totalling $47.8 million.
These items, already announced, included charges arising from the Federal Government&apos;s decision to cancel funding for the Opel rural and regional broadband network, a loss on the sale of the rail and bus operations, and restructuring and write-down costs arising from the improvement program being conducted by Elders Rural Services.
Profit, excluding the extraordinary items, was $84.2 million, still 20% below the previous year&apos;s profit and within the earlier announced range of $80-85 million. Revenue rose by 3% to $3.3 billion.
Chief executive Les Wozniczka, who has announced his resignation and will step down after his successor is appointed, said underlying profit was lower for several reasons.
These included a $16.9 million increase in interest expenses and a $9.3 million reduction in profit from 43%-owned AAco. He also reminded shareholders that the sale of property operations had contributed $21.5 million to 2006-07 profit.
The board declared a final, fully franked dividend of 5.5 a share, with a record date of October 2 and payable on October 28, taking the full-year franked dividend to 9.5.
Mr Wozniczka said future strategy would centre on the core business of Elders Rural Services, the progressive divestment of non-core assets, the reduction of debt, and expansion of the company&apos;s forestry estate and harvest operations.
Key initiatives would be put in place to improve the performance of the managed investment scheme (MIS) sales, which fell dramatically to $37.6 million, from $61.5 million the previous year.
Mr Wozniczka said conditions in rural and regional Australia were generally better than a year ago. &quot;Agricultural markets remain strong,&quot; he said. Elders, while finalising its new structure, would cautiously escalate its grain operations in the new deregulated wheat export market.
Mr Wozniczka said Futuris expected to increase its net underlying profit this financial year, which, as previously announced, would be in the range of $85-90 million. The result could be boosted by higher earnings from Futuris&apos; stake in Forest Enterprises Australia, he said.
The company&apos;s gearing at June 30 was 29% and net debt $523 million, compared with 24% and $364.9 million at the start of the year.
Futuris shares were up 5 to $1.30.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIAN Agricultural Company, after posting a first-half loss of $2.2 million, is confident higher cattle prices and rising demand from abroad will boost its performance in the coming year.
Looking ahead, Australia&apos;s biggest cattle company plans to double its herd to more than 1million by 2015, positioning itself to become &quot;the agricultural production powerhouse of Australia&quot;.
The $2.2 million loss for the six months to June 30 compared with a $5.9 million profit in the previous corresponding period.
Newly appointed chief executive Stephen Toms, who had been acting CEO, said cattle prices had been subdued due to the drought, exports had been hit by the strong $A, and grain and fuel costs had reached record levels.
Revenue for the period was down marginally to $123.6 million while gearing was 36%, down from 40% the previous year. The board declared an unfranked dividend of 7 a share, payable on October 16, with a record date of September 17.
Mr Thoms said operating cash flow was $5.9 million, compared with a negative $20 million the year before. The turnaround was mainly due to the sale of more than 121,000 cattle, mostly breeders, releasing $76.7 million in cash, he said.
Property values in northern Australia had continued to rise and rainfall patterns had returned to normal, except for the Northern Territory&apos;s Barkly Tablelands.
Mr Thoms said cattle prices had begun to turn, the $A was falling, and forward purchasing of grain had limited the impact of high prices, but fuel prices were expected to stay at high levels.
Internationally, he said the world supply of quality beef remained constrained as demand rose and the global herd size declined. US cattle production was tipped to decline and health issues were holding back South American quality beef.
Mr Thoms said Australia was holding its own in the Japanese and Korean beef markets despite the return of the US, and Russia and the Middle East were emerging markets.
Mr Thoms said AAco&apos;s long-term strategy was to increase the herd by 20% on the same land area and have three $100 million equity injections over 10 years. Land for the herd increase was likely to come from agricultural funds, with AAco managing the cattle for the funds, he said.
ABN Amro Morgan analyst Belinda Moore said speculation over the sale of Futuris Corp&apos;s 43% stake would continue to drive AAco&apos;s share price. The underlying real estate value of AAco&apos;s properties was a plus, with property sales in its area still rising in value, she said. AAco&apos;s shares closed unchanged at $3.01.

			<TEXT>AS the author of 21 books on bushranging history in Australia, it really makes me angry to read the recent press reports about a new theatre production called Black Mary, which is due to open at the Carriage Works Theatre in Redfern, Sydney, in the near future.
The author of this play, about the bushranger Frederick Ward, alias Captain Thunderbolt, and his part-Aboriginal wife, Mary Ann, makes the most outrageous claims about the two main characters.
First, it is claimed that Mary Ann (born 1834) &quot;was taken from her parents under government policy and sent to the Orphan School at Parramatta to be educated as a domestic maid&quot;. This is total codswallop, designed to elicit sympathy in keeping with the &quot;stolen children&quot; fad.
In fact, Mary Ann was the first of five children born to James Bugg (an overseer of shepherds for the Australian Agricultural Company) and his Aboriginal wife, Elizabeth, and was not &quot;taken from her parents&quot;, but with her brother, John (the second born), was sent by her father to private schools in Sydney, where they both received an excellent education.
Second, the author, Julie Janson, claims that the bushranger and his wife &quot;embarked on seven years of rollicking, rowdy bushranging - but always shooting to miss ... It was a point of honour that they didn&apos;t kill anybody.&quot; Again this is total rubbish. Ward wounded several police who were pursuing him and it was only the luck of the gods that they survived. This bush criminal was shooting to kill and that is the plain truth. On top of that, Mary Ann is never known to have ever fired at anyone, so how she could be included in the author&apos;s statement I don&apos;t know.
Third, Janson claims Ward and Mary Ann were not just &quot;bushrangers, but freedom fighters and revolutionaries&quot;, who were &quot;robbing the rich&quot;. Struth, what a load of crap. They were thieves who robbed at the point of a gun and the majority of their victims were working-class travellers on the road or small storekeepers with no insurance, trying to eke out a living in the bush.
Please protect our wonderful, exciting true history from the politically correct playwright.

			<TEXT>SWISS-based investor Urs Schwarzenback has reunited two historic holdings with his purchase of the valuable NSW property, Warrah Station.
Warrah joins Windy Station in the portfolio of Mr Schwarzenback&apos;s Romani Pastoral Co, which is understood to have paid less than $8 million for its latest acquisition.
The two properties, at Willow Tree near Quirindi, were part of the Australian Agricultural Co&apos;s original million-acre land grant in 1824.
Large portions changed hands due to soldier settlement and sales over the years, but Warrah and Windy Station were among the last retained by the Australian Agricultural Company.
It sold both a few years ago, with Windy Station going to Mr Schwarzenback for $19 million, and Warrah going to Korean giant Samsung for just over $9.1 million.
Samsung listed the property for sale after it started feeling the heat of the Asian financial meltdown earlier this year..
The corporate behemoth appears to have taken a bath on the deal, as it it understood to have spent at least $1 million on improvements to the 5797ha property. Elders negotiated the deal privately after closing tenders on May 8.
Agent David Hammersley said the deal demonstrated that some investors had the confidence to buy in what could only be seen as a counter-cyclical market. It showed the market always appreciated quality.
&quot;The big, well-known properties always draw plenty of inquiries,&quot; he said. &quot;It is probably the smaller, unknown and less well-located properties that are harder to sell,&quot; he said.
The sale also indicated a &quot;slow amalgamation&quot; across the country, where &quot;the big are getting bigger&quot;. &quot;No-one is paying any silly prices though,&quot; he said.
Samsung bought Warrah with the aim of breeding and fattening steers to the specifications of Korean markets.
Warrah, 5km west of Willow Tree, comprises 1500ha of deep, black-soil plains, 1200ha of gently sloping basalt cultivation country, and 3000ha of grazing country.
Lucerne is planted on 900ha, and there are winter cereal and summer crops. Other features are irrigation licences, large water storage and frontage to two creeks.
The eight-bedroom, three-bathroom homestead has large living areas and is set in established gardens with a pool and tennis court.
Mr Hammersley said Romani planned to lease the homestead and surrounding sections to an operator who could use it for conferences, as a corporate retreat or for farm-stays.
The property, four hours&apos; drive from Sydney, also has a four-bedroom manager&apos;s house, eight workers&apos; cottages, large sheds, workshops and silos, woolshed, stud cattle facilities and a 1000-head capacity cattle-feedlot.

			<TEXT>JANET Holmes a Court is no stranger to the tumult of high finance, yet by any measurement, this week has been a shocker for Australia&apos;s best known businesswoman.
It started out personal, with eldest son Peter joining a rival company, Australian Agricultural Co, headed by Alan Newman, her late husband Robert&apos;s closest acolyte.
It ended with a financial uppercut when Heytesbury, Holmes a Court&apos;s greatly diminished private company, received a $55 million bill for damages and legal fees after losing a marathon legal battle.
Years of management and financial difficulties, and the subsequent forced selling of assets, have already cast Holmes a Court from this year&apos;s Business Review Weekly rich list.
By late 1999 Heytesbury had palmed off 70 per cent of construction company John Holland Engineering. A much better deal ensued when Andrew Lloyd Webber paid a hefty $220 million for Heytesbury&apos;s London theatre chain.
Yet in the decade since the death of Robert Holmes a Court, the once daunting billion-dollar family business empire, which at its height threatened to take over BHP, is now a relative shell, albeit a lucrative and fun shell - Heytesbury now centres on a winery, a horse stud, cattle stations, vintage cars and art.
Holmes a Court insists her family company had kept funds aside to cover the $55 million payout, the result of international arbitration of a 1996 dispute between former Heytesbury construction subsidiary John Holland and Toyo Engineering. Yet until this week Heytesbury was confident of winning the judgment and being awarded a similar amount.
Still, as the Holmes a Court empire faces its latest obstacle, the widow who inherited the ailing giant from her adventurous husband may well be hurt more by her son&apos;s latest business venture.
&quot;The single biggest disappointment in her post-Robert life has been her inability to get her children to share the future of Heytesbury as she saw it,&quot; wrote Holmes a Court&apos;s friend Patricia Edgar in her recent biography.
Mother and son were both playing down any rift this week. &quot;She gets pretty sick of this family feud talk,&quot; one Heytesbury insider said this week. &quot;Families have disputes, companies have disputes and family companies have disputes. In the end, people forget that quite apart from being a businesswoman, Janet is a mother and, whatever happens on the business side, family&apos;s very important to her.&quot;
Only Catherine, Holmes a Court&apos;s daughter, seems faintly interested in sticking with Heytesbury as a relatively passive shareholder. Her other sons, Simon and Paul, have indicated they will eventually follow elder brother Peter into their own ventures.
Curiously, Holmes a Court&apos;s falling business stocks don&apos;t appear to have tainted her reputation. Late last year a PWC survey listed her as the fifth most admired business leader in Australia.
Fortunately for Holmes a Court, her relationship with childhood friend Frits Steenhauer has rejuvenated her private life.
&quot;I feel that Frits has given me back my life,&quot; she wrote this year. &quot;Frits has always, like me, followed his nose.&quot;
Steenhauer&apos;s nose is currently to the grindstone - as the University of Western Australia&apos;s financial director, he has been assigned to oversee Perth&apos;s International Arts Festival after last year&apos;s financial disaster.
From all accounts, Steenhauer is helping turn around the ailing festival. Holmes a Court has said she never seeks his advice on company matters. Perhaps she should start.

			<TEXT>AMONG several prominent offerings at Beef Week 2000 in Rockhampton, three northern stations worth a total of more than $10 million will go to auction today.
The 679,886ha Northern Territory property Manners Creek - and its 8000 cattle - is expected to fetch more than $5 million when it goes under the Ray White hammer on behalf of vendor Laurie Facer.
Agent Lex Heinemann said the property could carry 20,000 cattle and was strategically located, being 270km south-west of Mt Isa and adjoining Stanbroke Pastoral Co&apos;s Lake Nash and Australian Agricultural Co&apos;s Headingly.
On offer at the same auction will be Bob and Bette Condor&apos;s 19,172ha Beenfield/Kevin Downs aggregation near Julia Creek, and Jack and May Fraser&apos;s 45,732ha Alehvale near Croydon in the Gulf Country.
* Lure of ocean breezes ALSO in Rockhampton today, Primac Elders will auction the coastal cattle stations Long Island and Stanage Bay, north of Rockhampton.
The properties can run a total of 1800 cattle and the mainland station Stanage Bay has 4km of beach frontage.
Agent Andrew Adcock said they would be offered separately. The properties have been owned since the early 1990s by Arn and Ian Barnes, and Rod Tate, and could fetch a total of $2.5 million.
* EU accreditation attracts A SIGNIFICANT north-western Queensland cattle station now being marketed is the 182,483ha Brackenburgh on the Middleton Channels.
Distinguished by its EU-accredited herd of 10,000 santa gertrudis cattle, it is expected to fetch more than $6 million after tenders close on May 8 with Wesfarmers Dalgety.
Agent David Tannock, offering the property on behalf of Duncan and Lesley Lawton, says it is one of the largest herds in the state to achieve &quot;this privileged status within European market specifications&quot;.
Mr Lawton&apos;s father bought the original Brackenburgh block after World War II and he has added to it considerably since then to make up the current vast pastoral holding, which takes in part of the Diamantina system.
&quot;Anyone who inspects Brackenburgh cannot fail to be impressed by its obvious profitability and the quality of the herd, the country and the improvements,&quot; Mr Tannock said.
A buyer would receive generous tax apportionments, he said.
Brackenburgh is 170km west of Winton and has frontage to the bitumen Kennedy development road at Middleton. It is 340km north-west of Longreach and is 750km from each of the live export ports of Karumba and Townsville.
The property is being offered on a walk-in, walk-out basis, with 10,000 branded cattle with calves at foot and 1300 steers ready for market, providing &quot;an established business with an uninterrupted income stream&quot;, according to Wesfarmers.
* First online rural auction WHAT is billed as the nation&apos;s first online rural auction takes place next Wednesday in Brisbane with the offering of the central Queensland cattle property Rewan.
On behalf of vendor Wayne Veivers, Wesfarmers Dalgety is handling the sale of the 17,479ha holding, which occupies a valley floor on the approaches to the Carnarvon Gorge and National Park, 62km south of Rolleston.
* Bulgandramine withdrawn ROB and Carol McCalman&apos;s 3656ha Bulgrandamine East between Parkes and Dubbo was withdrawn from sale before its scheduled Elders auction last week.
With more than 7km of Bogan River frontage, the property&apos;s sale would have been of interest. Its seven-bedroom, circa-1921 homestead also was a feature.
* Tilpa blocks prove popular ELDERS received an enthusiastic response to its auction recently of large Western Lands Lease and freehold properties on the Darling River at Tilpa in western NSW.
The auction was held in Dubbo, five hours&apos; drive away, but 70 people attended - including neighbours - to provide keen competition. The blocks, which are 193km from Bourke and 184km from Cobar, all sold under the hammer.
Agent Denis McGrath said the 12,642ha WLL and freehold property Nargoon, adjoining the Tilpa Hotel, sold for $305,000 to Dennis Huntley from Werribee.
The 4128ha WLL holding Parkers sold to Bernard Davey from Sydney for $212,000, and the 6292ha WLL and freehold Greens, across the river from the Tilpa Hotel, sold to Phillip Wall from Wee Waa for $127,500. Ken and Hazel Newman and family had held the blocks for 67 years.

			<TEXT>* Remote data AN electronic livestock information system is beingtested by the Queensland government.
The system, which puts information on availability of stock online,belongs to the Australian Agricultural Company, run by Peter Holmes aCourt.
The trial is moving into a second phase with two more agriculturalgroups considering putting information online.
The Queensland Department of State Development&apos;s Qe-meat project, runin conjunction with Meat &amp; Livestock Australia and Australian CountryChoice, is designed to promote Australian beef globally.
&quot;My dream is to deliver meat with a barcode to the supermarket, orlisting a URL, so customers can see the animal&apos;s whole history,&quot; MrHolmes a Court said.
He said the consumer information concept would take time to perfect,but eventually it would be a basic requirement in beef marketing.
&quot;Because of quality issues, identification and verification of meat isgoing to be needed to compete on world markets,&quot; he said.
The project was purely consumer-oriented, and not required for countingor tracking cattle, he said.
Australian beef producers would lead their US counterparts in using thesystem, as US producers usually ran less stock on smaller properties.
AACo runs 401,000 cattle on 18 cattle stations across north Queenslandand the Northern Territory, including the famous Brunette Downs.
After two years of trials, AACo is using a system in which data iscollected on handheld devices in remote locations, delivered to ahomestead computer and shared at a Brisbane operations centre.
Data is recorded in XML, then emailed by digital radio telephone.
In the next stage, data would be sent by satellite, enabling fastertransmission of voice and graphic information, Mr Holmes a Court said.

			<TEXT>* Agriculture THE Peter Holmes a Court-led Australian Agricultural Cohas warned that a blow-out in grain and fuel prices will weigh heavilyon the group&apos;s financial performance for the 2002 full year.
AACo, Australia&apos;s second-largest beef company, yesterday said itspre-tax maiden profit fell 22.8 per cent despite record cattle pricesas an extended wet season and delayed live-export shipment dragged onsales.
AACo delivered earnings before interest tax and management fees of$29.5 million compared with $38.2 million a year earlier. The result,while in line with the company&apos;s forecasts, failed to impress investorswho sold the stock lower. Shares in AACo closed 2c weaker at 82c.
No after-tax result was released to the market.
Since listing on the Australian Stock Exchange in early August, AACo&apos;sshares have struggled, failing to meet their $1 a share retail issueprice. Institutional investors who paid $1.10 a share are also well outof the money.
Mr Holmes a Court said the longer than usual wet season reduced saleswhile external freight issue restricted stock movement as well asdelaying a live-export shipment.
He was, however, more optimistic about the future - in particularstronger than forecast cattle prices.
&quot;Current market prices have risen in the region of 10 per cent sincethe start of the financial year, supported by strong demand forAustralian beef,&quot; he said.
&quot;Should such conditions continue for the year, revenue from cattlesales and expenses for cattle purchases are likely to be higher thanforecast,&quot; he said.
Australian beef producers have enjoyed some of the best conditions inmore than a decade as Foot and Mouth disease and Mad Cow disease ravagestocks in Europe and South America.
AACo&apos;s revenues fell 15.3 per cent to $81.93 million as it sold 12,858fewer cattle this year to 120,619 compared with 133,477 head a yearago.
Also dragging on the result was the $516,000 cost as a result of achange in accounting treatment.
AACo which is 40 per cent owned by diversified investors Futuris Corpdid not declare a dividend.

			<TEXT>BEEF producer The Australian Agricultural Company failed to live up tobullish expectations when it listed on the Australian Stock Exchangeyesterday.
The anticipated stampede on shares in the 177-year-old cattle rancher,the second-largest in Australia, did not eventuate after its initial$111 million public offering was heavily oversubscribed.
It was the second arrival for AACo, which listed in 1974 but wasacquired by Elders in 1995.
As AACo chairman David Hills watched the trades scroll down the screenat the stock exchange in Sydney it became clear the run had startedwith a stumble when the shares opened at 99c, below the issue price forretail investors of $1 and $1.10 for institutions.
The stock rose as high as $1.04 but never gained momentum and finishedat 99c.
&quot;As to where it will finish up, I don&apos;t know ... I think we&apos;ll be quitehappy around about this $1.03, $1.05 mark,&quot; Mr Hills said.
Any disappointment is understandable: the initial offer of more than100 million shares was as much as 50 per cent to 100 per centoversubscribed and AACo was forced to close the offering early.
Futuris Corp, which owns 32 per cent of AACo, gave up an extra 7.8million shares to meet the demand.
AACo chief executive Peter Holmes a Court, son of legendary corporateraider Robert, bought $15 million worth of shares himself.
With the low dollar, record cattle prices and disease scares in thenorthern hemisphere giving Australia new market inroads, this was theright time to list a cattle producer, Mr Hills said.
&quot;Things like e-coli, foot and mouth disease and BSE (mad cow disease)have really shown that Australia can produce a clean, green product,&quot;Mr Hills said.
But Reynolds &amp; Co broker David Heath said these extremes also give it ahigh-risk profile. He predicted the shares would struggle around theissue price in the short term. &quot;If cattle prices go down or if thedollar starts to rise it could be vulnerable,&quot; he said.
AACo plans to increase its herd of 380,000 animals in the NorthernTerritory and Queensland to one million before it embarks onacquisitions it hopes will take it beyond the farm gate intoprocessing.
AACo directors have forecast a $21.1 million net profit this year.

			<TEXT>* Agriculture BEEF producer Australian Agricultural Co says first-quarterpre-tax earnings have slumped 55 per cent, dragged down by a sharp drop incattle prices as drought ravages the continent.
But the result was better than the company&apos;s internal forecasts, and in linewith market expectations.
Shares in AAC closed 1c firmer at 74c as chief executive Peter Holmes aCourt reaffirmed that the world&apos;s second largest beef producer had a strongbalance sheet and would look for acquisitions.
In the three months to September 30, earnings fell to $7.7 million comparedto $17.1 million a year earlier. Sales for the group were 18 per cent weakerat $25.7 million. The 36 per cent slump in cattle prices weighed heavily onthe balance sheet.
Costs for the quarter rose because of extra feeding, higher grain costs andwater supply improvement, Mr Holmes a Court said.
&quot;Despite the continuing dry conditions, we are maintaining our full-yearexpectations ... 10 to 20 per cent lower than the full-year results achievedin 2002,&quot; he said.
Mr Holmes a Court indi cated there could be some benefit from acquisitionsover the next year, including the Aronui Feedlot, which he announcedyesterday.
AAC will pay its first interim dividend in May.

			<TEXT>MACQUARIE Equities has identified eight key &quot;drought sensitive&quot; stocksmost likely to be hurt by the prolonged dry spell.
Such stocks underperformed by 20 per cent during the previous majordroughts in 1994-95 and 1997-98.
The eight companies are: beef producer Australian Agricultural Co;grain-related companies AWB, ABB and Grain Corp; farm services companyFuturis; chemical maker Nufarm; Queensland Cotton Holdings; andstock-feed miller Ridley Corp.
&quot;Assessing the drought&apos;s impact on specific companies is difficult,&quot;said equity strategist John Kyriakopoulos in a research note.
&quot;So our list of `drought&apos; sensitive stocks needs to be treated with anappropriate degree of caution.&quot;
The bad news didn&apos;t affect the companies&apos; share prices yesterday. It&apos;slikely investors have already factored the drought into theirvaluations.
AAC fell 2c to 70c, while AWB rose 4c to $3.59.
Futuris rose 1c to $1.28, but was well off its 12-month high of $1.97,reached in February.
ABB rose 8c to $2.60, Grain Corp was steady at 9.05, Nufarm fell 1c to$3.63, Queensland Cotton was steady at $3.24, and Ridley Corp rose 2cto $1.37.
The local stock market finished marginally lower yesterday, despiteWall Street&apos;s big fall on Wednesday night.
The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index closed down 4 points to 2989.8, whilethe all ordinaries index fell 2.2 points to 2946.6.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell almost 3 per cent, down 219.65points to 8036.03.
JB Were On-call manager Mike Kendall said investors had pulled theirmoney out of banks and put it into stocks exposed to foreign earnings.
&quot;We&apos;ve seen selling pressure on the National and the Commonwealth, anda rotation out of the banking sector,&quot; he said.
NAB fell 51c to $32.17, CBA fell 46c to $29.05, and Westpac fell 11c to$13.43. ANZ rose 1c to $18.04.
Mr Kendall said some investors had moved their bank allocations intooffshore banks, which were trading on a cheaper multiple.
&quot;People are also buying Australian stocks that could be exposed to aglobal rebound, like the resources, AMP and News,&quot; he said.
BHP Billiton rose 14c to $9.79. Rio Tinto rose 25c to $31.60.
News Corp rose 22c to $10.03.
AMP continued its good run, closing up 12c to $12.80.
Shares in gaming group Jupiters fell 12.5 per cent after the companylowered its first-half profit expectations by 10 per cent. Jupitersclosed down 71c to $4.97.
Mr Kendall said the market was &quot;continuing the trend of aggressivelyselling off companies that disappoint or predict a disappointment&quot;.
Shares in blood products maker CSL fell 11 per cent, closing down $2.42to $18.96.

			<TEXT>ONE of Australia&apos;s rural barons argues the drought has been exacerbated bythe nation&apos;s history of appalling water management.
&quot;There are parts of Australia where we could not be doing it worse,&quot; saidAustralian Agricultural Company chief executive Peter Holmes a Court.
&quot;Uncapped bores still exist - just holes in the ground with water streamingout,&quot; he said.
&quot;We have unirrigated land in places where people have unrestricted access towater. There is broadly ineffective management of the watercourses. Thereare rivers that are shallow and salty that are being over-used, and riversthat are wide and plentiful that are not being utilised.&quot;
One of the founders of the Farmhand Foundation, Mr Holmes a Court wants toput water policy on the national agenda. A more efficient and effectivesystem of water usage would ameliorate the damage of future droughts.
&quot;We must have a national water policy, national water management,&quot; he said.
&quot;We need to be aligned on how we use the water in this country to maximisesustainable production. We haven&apos;t done a good job in the past, and it willbe expensive to fix. This is an incredible continent; amazing bounty. If wescrew up how we water it, we&apos;re going to kill it.&quot;
Mr Holmes a Court, son of the late corporate raider Robert, returned toAustralia last year after 16 years living abroad, mostly in the US andBritain. As the new boss of the nation&apos;s second-biggest cattle business, hewas dumped in the deep end of the beef market upheavals - with drought, madcow disease in Japan and global tension following September 11.
His office is in Sydney&apos;s CBD, but he spends a lot of time on the road. &quot;I&apos;mfortunate to spend half my life in the city and half in the country, withwhat I do,&quot; he said. &quot;But this (drought) is not a city-country thing, it&apos;san Australian thing.&quot;

			<TEXT>* Results ROBUST cattle prices have propelled the Australian Agricultural Coto a profit well ahead of the prospectus forecast, but it warned yesterdaythat recent falls would slice earnings for the current financial year.
The 178-year-old company led by Peter Holmes a Court, son of the latecorporate raider Robert, yesterday declared a profit of $20.6 million for2001-02, 30 per cent higher than the previous year.
The increase was fuelled predominantly by a jump in sales revenue from $82million to $94 million and an increase in the market value of the company&apos;sherd, which finished the year 5 per cent larger at 407,000 head.
But Mr Holmes a Court said prices had dropped 10 per cent between Januaryand June this year and, while the company was confident they would riseagain, it was unlikely to achieve the same levels as 12 months ago.
Consequently, earnings could be up to 20 per cent lower in the current yearthan the year just finished. He said that the company was moving into morevalue-added activities such as direct sales to restaurants and to retailers,so it was not as reliant on fixed cattle prices.
&quot;In the year we&apos;ve just had, our value-adding activities have been about 1per cent of revenue and we want to lift that to 10 per cent this year, witha long-term aim of 50 per cent,&quot; he said. Mr Holmes a Court added that thedrought was only affecting one of AACo&apos;s 19 properties.
Yesterday, AACo also announced that it was picking up a 51 per cent interestin Rural Management Partners, a business that manages 16 properties with16,000 head of cattle.
&quot;That&apos;s the sort of thing we&apos;ll be looking at in the future - where thecattle can actually come into our system but we don&apos;t have the expense ofbuying the land beneath them,&quot; he said.
He said AACo was confident that the federal Government would soon solve theproblem of the beef-quota allocation into the US, and also that the LakesCreek abattoir at Rockhampton would reopen under the management of TeysBrothers.
&quot;They&apos;re good operators, and it will be good to have strong competition forthe foreign-owned processors in the abattoirs,&quot; he said.
The market reacted well to the AACo result. It finished the day at 75c, again of 7 per cent from its 70c opening.

			<TEXT>Farmers have a beef MAKE hay while the sun shines. The trouble forAustralian farmers though, is that the sun - metaphorically speaking atleast - never shines for too long.
Pinning their hopes on a strong dollar, strong cattle prices and surgingrural property prices, Australian farmers are now begining to feel the pinchas the tide turns.
Shares in cattle producer the Australian Agricultural Company (AAC) fellhard yesterday after cattle prices slumped 3.7 per cent to $2.87 a kilogramon the benchmark Eastern Young Indicator.
Early last month AAC, warned that falling cattle prices would slice about 20per cent off the company&apos;s expected full-year net profit to $23.2 million.
But the market appears now to be preparing for the worst.
AAC shares are now trading at a six-month low and cattle prices have lostmore than 20 per cent of their value this year.
AAC shares closed 2c weaker at 73 cents.
Stench of methane ONE day a rooster, the next a feather duster, as ArthurCalwell once said.
So, too, might Peter Botten, managing director of Oil Search (OSH) who wasriding high earlier this week on the expectation the PNG Government is aboutto sign, after three years of negotiations, an agreement covering fiscalterms for the proposed PNG to Queensland gas pipeline.
But yesterday the Queensland Government pricked Oil Search&apos;s balloon byannouncing the fuel source for the Townsville power station would be coalseam methane rather than PNG gas.
At 20 petajoules a year, the Townsville contract was never, on its own,going to be a project maker for Oil Search and its PNG partners.
But it would have helped.
Which makes the next few months doubly important for Botten and his boss,one-time media chief Trevor Kennedy, as the PNG project trawls Queensland toconfirm industrial markets that could provide foundation contracts for PNGgas.
The market was not amused at the Townsville decision, sending Oil Searchscrip 19c through the floor to close at 88 cents, its lowest since lastSeptember. More than 42 million shares changed hands.
Bankers hit the wall GIVEN that any business deal is predicated on a willingseller and a willing buyer, ANZ Bank Indonesian associate Panin Bank&apos;schances of buying Bank Niaga could be summed up quite simply: Buckley&apos;s andnone. Judging from yesterday&apos;s comments by Indonesian authorities, there isa gaping abyss between the asking price and that offered by several biddingparties including Panin-ANZ.
The nation&apos;s Enterprise Minister Laksamana Sukardi said the sale price ofthe 51 per cent controlling stake on offer would be based on the marketprice (more or less).
On May 27, the deadline for the bids, Niaga shares were going for 80 rupiah($0.00937) a pop. Bank analysts, however, reckon Niaga&apos;s real value is onlyabout 14 rupiah, and it&apos;s odds on that Panin-ANZ bid more like 14 than 80.
The ANZ says there are no plans for a higher bid.
This suggests that peace between Pakistan and India is more probable than asale, in the short term at least.
The wildly different valuation stems from the Indonesian Bank RestructuringAuthority&apos;s 97.15 per cent ownership of Niaga, leaving only 3 per cent infree float.
ANZ shares added 2c to $19.40.
GroPep wilts in heat IT was not a matter of a bad deal. Rather, that thehigh didn&apos;t last so long.
GroPep investors could have been forgiven for having a queasy stomach by theend of the day after their stock soared 21 per cent in early trading beforeslumping almost as far.
Shares in the struggling biotech were reacting to the unveiling of plans onMonday night to move into the black in 2003-04.
On top of that, the Adelaide-based company promised to cap all that spendingon its pharmaceutical drug development business.
It said it would instead narrow its focus towards the fewer but higherquality businesses.
All those promises, it appears, got investors into an almighty lather andthe stock rose 16c to 93c.
But it was short lived.
By noon most of the puff had evaporated and the stock closed up just 3c at80c.
Seems a bit more patience is needed for those who bought into the stock at$1.80 in a placement in March this year.
That&apos;s if you didn&apos;t get out yesterday.

			<TEXT>* Agriculture AUSTRALIAN Agricultural Company has cut its full-year profitforecast by more than 17 per cent, blaming mad cows, US quotas and theweather.
Nonetheless, the company said it was handling the volatile market well -despite cattle prices having fallen 13 per cent already this year.
Releasing results for the nine months to the end of March yesterday, AACosaid it now expected full-year net profit of $23.2 million, compared with aFebruary forecast of $28.1 million. That&apos;s still 10 per cent better than itsprospectus forecast of $21.1 million.
The revised forecast stems from lower export demand, which is expected todrive down cattle prices in the final quarter.
AACo blamed the drop in demand on a mad-cow scare in Japan, US quotalimitations and dry weather conditions.
&quot;The company is limiting the impact through the transfer of cattle acrossits portfolio of properties and by expanding its domestic sales program,&quot;chief executive Peter Holmes a Court said.
However, the number and timing of cattle sales and prices in the fourthquarter, and cattle prices at June 30, 2002, would be critical for thecompany to meet its latest forecast.
The medium-term outlook for beef prices is expected to remain at currentlevels into the first half of 2002/03.
Mr Holmes a Court said that &quot;despite the tougher conditions beingexperienced&quot; the company was doing well.
&quot;The strength of our prop erty portfolio, combined with our growing abilityto supply the domestic market should allow the company to exceed prospectusforecasts,&quot; he said.
However, costs were expected to be higher for the full year because of arise in insurance, fuel and grain prices.
For the nine months to March, AACo said earnings before interest and taxrose almost 26 per cent to 22.9 million, on the back of a jump in sales ofmore than 17 per cent to $65.8 million.
The company did not release third-quarter figures.
AACo relisted on the ASX in August last year, when its stock debuted at 99c.The share price closed down 1c yesterday at 81c.

			<TEXT>`It was a very demanding and volatile time in which to list&apos; Peter Holmes aCourt Australian Agricultural Co chief executive Simone Pitsis * ResultsNEWLY listed Australian Agricultural Co has finished the half-year ahead offorecasts despite a global economic downturn.
Chief executive Peter Holmes a Court said events of September 11, anthraxand the outbreak of mad-cow disease in Japan had proved a major challenge tothe company&apos;s listing in August.
&quot;It was a very demanding and volatile time in which to list, but on the onehand our business turned in a half-year result almost double prospectusforecasts,&quot; Mr Holmes a Court said.
AACo made a net profit of $28.1 million in the December half, ahead of theprospectus forecast of $21.7 million.
Holmes a Court, just back from an investment trip to Asia, said the177-year-old company was now in a position to allocate lucrative stockoptions for Asian investors.
&quot;When we went public we got a huge amount of interest from and out of Asiabut the offering was over-subscribed domestically and when we went to do theallocations we didn&apos;t have stock to give Asian clients.&quot;
Mr Holmes a Court said interest from regions in Asia was overwhelmingbecause they could not rely on their food chain to provide them withconsistent and safe food - especially animal products.
AACo sells about 34 million kg of beef a year, a third of which goes toJapan and other Asian countries.
&quot;Everything Asian investors buy is described by the region from which itcame, so it&apos;s always sold as Australian pork, Australian beef, Australiancheese and wine.
&quot;These regions understand the need for these Australian products becausethey have been living through a period where they don&apos;t have the security oforigin of their product.&quot;
Recent outbreaks of mad-cow disease in Japan have hurt demand for beef,which Mr Holmes said reinforced rather than changed AACo&apos;s plans.
&quot;It is a short-term problem, yes; but even if people are eating less beef,they are eating more Australian beef.&quot;
Besides seeking to raise the company&apos;s profile among Singapore and otherAsian investors, Holmes a Court&apos;s recent trip was also to tap the localmarket for its joint venture with Australia&apos;s oldest clothing company, RMWilliams, to offer tours to outback Australia.
The proposed outback tours are built around the principle of African tentsafaris, which will allow the tour operators to go into areas of the countrythat would normally be inaccessible.
&quot;We had a a few people hold up their hands to come on these outback trips -interest was based on the opportunity for people living in Asia to get outof the towers of Singapore and Honk Kong,&quot; said Mr Holmes a Court.

			<TEXT>* Results AUSTRALIAN Agricultural Company expects to better its full-yearearnings forecast by more than 20 per cent despite a likely fall in cattleprices during the current quarter.
Australia&apos;s second-largest beef producer yesterday announcedstronger-than-forecast net profit and earnings for the first six months ofthe year, as local cattle producers enjoyed record prices and high sales.
Chief executive Peter Holmes a Court said AACo has lifted forecast earningsbefore interest and tax to $43.7 million for 2001-02 - 23 per cent aboveforecasts in the company&apos;s prospectus.
Net profit after tax for the full year has also been increased, to $28.1million - 33 per cent higher than prospectus forecasts.
The revised forecasts were &quot;appropriately conservative&quot;, Mr Homes a Courtsaid, and assumed cattle prices during the third quarter would fall 7.5 percent with no change for the fourth quarter.
AACo noted that cattle prices in January were about 5-7 per cent below thoseat the end of December 2001.
Nonetheless, Mr Holmes a Court said there were strong signs that demand forbeef in Japan would pick up towards the middle of the year, and thatAustralian producers were increasing their market share there.
The outbreak of mad cow disease in Japan caused a slump in Australian beefexports and pushed cattle prices down towards the end of last year.
AACo is 30 per cent-owned by rural services and automotive systems companyFuturis Corp. AACo&apos;s share price closed 2c weaker at 93 cents, after a highof 97c.
Mr Holmes a Court, who yesterday began a three-week roadshow taking inAustralia, Hong Kong and Britain, said he was &quot;not in the slightest&quot;disappointed by the market&apos;s reaction.
AACo&apos;s share price has fallen 6 per cent since it began trading on the ASXin August last year.
&quot;I&apos;d rather it be undervalued than overvalued,&quot; he said, noting that at thecurrent market capitalisation, investors valued AACo&apos;s cattle at $450 ahead, compared with their average market price of $900 a head over the pastsix months. Nor did this take into account the company&apos;s $120 million landholdings.
AACo more than doubled its net profit after tax to $28.1 million for the sixmonths to December 31, 2001 - up from $11.9 million a year earlier.

			<TEXT>Is the market being given a bum steer THE way Australian Agricultural Cosees it, the market is yet to come to grips with how to value the company.The second largest beef producer in the country yesterday reported more thandoubled earnings in the December half (which already exceeds its full-yearprospectus profit forecast), only to see the share price dip 2c to 93c.
But there was more than normal interest in the stock, with 2.6 millionshares traded, about 10 times the normal daily volume.
The 178-year-old company, Australia&apos;s largest, was bought several years agoby Alan Newman&apos;s Futuris Corp and refloated last August at an issue price of$1 a share. The shares haven&apos;t sold above the issue price since listing anddropped as low as 72c last October. They&apos;ve since recovered steadily and arenow within sight of the issue price.
At $1 a share, AACo would have a market capitalisation of $185 million -which would value its beef herd at $450 a head, and contain no allowance forland, buildings and improvements.
During the half year, an independent valuation was obtained of land,buildings and improvements that resulted in an unbooked surplus of $21.2million over book value. If that was taken into account, the herd would bevalued at $540 a head.
Yet the average price received for its cattle in the past half year wasabout $900 a head, which would support a share price of $2 and a marketcapitalisation of $370 million. At the very least it shows there&apos;s asignificant gap between market valuation and current realisable value ofassets.
Of course, it&apos;s a very convenient time in the cycle for AACo. Cattle pricesare strong - rising more than 15 per cent in the December half - andseasonal conditions were excellent in the last half. That latter fact,together with increased breeding productivity flowing from AACo&apos;s seven-yearinvestment in its breeding program, resulted in a strong natural increase incattle numbers of almost 49,000 head over the past six months and a record122,000 on a calendar basis. The herd stood at 408,000 at December 31 - a7.4 per cent increase on the 380,000 a year earlier. Sales for the sixmonths rose 14 per cent to 14 million kg.
The main factor behind the dramatic earnings gain is a change in accounting.AACo now uses market value accounting in place of absorption costaccounting. That means the cattle are now marked to market whereaspreviously they were valued on an average cost basis, which included theallocation of station running costs on a full absorption basis.
EBIT jumped $24.2 million (142 per cent), from $17 million to $41.2 million,while after-tax profit rose $16.2 million (136 per cent), from $11.9 millionto $28.1 million. Marking to market accounts for $21.3 million, or just over50 per cent, of first-half EBIT.
Reflecting the higher prices for cattle, cash flow rose solidly, from$200,000 to $7.1 million, and is expected to remain strong in the secondhalf. But cattle prices are off the top, which - as a result of marking tomarket - will affect second-half earnings.
In the prospectus, AACo forecast an EBIT of $35.7 million for the year toJune 2002 and net profit of $21.1 million. That has been easily exceeded bythe first-half earnings but the directors are now forecasting only amarginal further increase for the full year - EBIT of $43.7 million and anet profit of $28.1 million.
That would indicate an EBIT of only $2.5 million in the second half.However, that is an expected outcome of marking to market. Since late lastyear cattle prices have softened, reflecting factors such as the BSE &quot;madcow&quot; outbreak in Japan.
The new forecast assumes a 7.5 per cent reduction in the average cattleprice for the third quarter, and that prices will hold that level in thefinal quarter. Management has provided a sensitivity analysis that indicateseach 1 per cent change in cattle prices, plus or minus, will affect EBIT by$2 million and cash flow by $600,000.
Thus, a 7.5 per cent fall in prices suggests an EBIT impact, from marking tomarket, of $15 million. That will be more than absorbed by operationalearnings, resulting in a small profit increase for the quarter.
It would also not surprise if the latest earnings forecast errs on theconservative side, to improve AACo&apos;s chances of beating the forecast ratherthan falling short.
AACo chief Peter Holmes a Court yesterday began a 3 1/2 week roadshow tobrief analysts on the company performance and its business strategy. It willcover all Australian capitals, Singapore, London, Edinburgh and Hong Kong.Next month he will repeat the exercise in the US, at Los Angeles, Denver (acattle town) and New York.
AACo sells 34 million kg of beef a year, for about $100 million, but whichhas a &quot;street value&quot; of more than $2 billion. AACo wants capture some ofthat difference by moving into the value chain, in particular throughbranding of meats, at wholesale and retail levels. That would not only boostearnings but reduce their volatility. Prices are nowhere near as volatile atthe retail level as at the commodity level.
AACo made a start in November through the purchase of a majority interest ina Melbourne-based beef retailer, Polkinghorne&apos;s. The business was begun byfarmer Rod Polkinghorne, and enables him to effectively sell his cattle fromhis property to the retail customer. Polkinghorne developed the MeatsStandards of Australia system for grading meats, which enables him toguarantee product control.
He sells from a store in Melbourne&apos;s Albert Park, where the meat is not soldas particular cuts (rump, sirloin, chuck, fillet, etc) but by its purpose(grilling, frying, roasting and so on). Polkinghorne&apos;s brands include Shumi(thin sliced), Wok Stir (stir fry) and Rodz (grilling steak).
AACo sees potential for branded beef to be sold to intermediaries, such asrestaurants, and to the retail customer, through the supermarkets. Chickenis already largely sold by brand but 20 years ago it wasn&apos;t. Cereals too,used to be sold out of bins, until Kellog&apos;s, in 1906, put corn flakes intoboxes.
It&apos;s already happening in the US, where branded beef now accounts for about10 per cent of the market, and is growing rapidly, supplied by groups suchas Omaha Steaks, Harris Ranch and Laura&apos;s Lean Beef. The beef can be soldstraight out of branded cases.
US retail chain Walmart, America&apos;s largest grocer, recently switched toselling 100 per cent of beef via &quot;case ready&quot; product. It did so because itwas more efficient than employing teams of butchers at its various outletsto cut up delivered carcasses and package them in clear wrap.
If AACo is right, that would enable the local supermarket operators to cutcosts and sell branded beef, with guaranteed quality control, at competitiveprices. And of course AACo would be a big beneficiary.

			<TEXT>TWO of Australia&apos;s most renowned outback dynasties will join forces tooffer overseas tourists an &quot;authentic outback experience&quot;, linking theR.M. Williams brand with Australia&apos;s oldest rural enterprise.
&quot;I&apos;m incredibly fortunate,&quot; said Peter Holmes a Court, chief executiveof beef producers the Australian Agricultural Company.
&quot;I run a company and when I go out to the properties to see what we&apos;redoing I stand in some of the most stunning locations I&apos;ve ever been toon the planet.&quot;
A joint venture between the two Australian companies, Authentic OutbackTours will be run by a third party and will begin operating in early2003.
&quot;We both share a passion for this,&quot; said Mr Holmes a Court.
&quot;We saw an opportunity to put the two activities of the companiestogether to give the authentic outback experience.&quot;
The business will target the top end of the international market andthe lucrative incentive market, offering the &quot;real experience&quot; of theoutback with no expense spared and low impact to the environment, saidMr Holmes a Court.
Visitors will stay in five-star, climate-controlled tent accommodation,dine on first-class cuisine and wine, and take part in &quot;tailoredexperiences&quot; such as fishing for barramundi and working with cattle.Or, as Mr Holmes a Court said, &quot;being dropped in by helicopter to thetop of a ridge somewhere&quot;.
&quot;Our company has been in agriculture in Australia for 178 years, R.M.Williams has put together a bevy of stories and experience from his 70years of operations in the business, and what we believe we can do isoffer people a look into properties, stock routes, water holes, thathave never been seen before by anyone outside the company.&quot;
R.M. Williams chief executive Hamish Turner said &quot;that type of style iswhat the market is demanding, but at the end of the day they (people)want to go out and rough it to say they have had the experience.&quot;
Mr Turner said tourism was underdeveloped in the outback and there wasa demand for high-quality tours. Australia has 1 million visitors tothe outback each year.
In the past five years tourism had made up 30 per cent of the R.M.Williams business in Australia. &quot;That&apos;s because people see us asrepresenting rural Australia,&quot; Mr Turner said.
And AACo will have no shortage of properties to show off - it ownsapproximately 1 per cent Australia, including 3 per cent ofQueensland.

			<TEXT>* Agribusiness SHARES in Australian Agricultural Company climbed 5 per centhigher after the company announced it expected to exceed its forecast $21.5million full-year profit.
One of the world&apos;s largest cattle companies, AACo said cattle prices in thesecond quarter to December 31 had continued to strengthen from Octoberlevels.
&quot;AACo announces its preliminary expectation that earnings for the full yearto June 2002 are likely to considerably exceed prospectus forecasts,&quot; thecompany said.
The company had previously forecast a net profit of $21.1 million for theyear to June 30, on total sales of $90.28 million.
AACo noted that when it announced its results for the first quarter toSeptember 30, 2001 in November the company was on track to exceed prospectusforecasts.
Since then cattle prices have continued to strengthen, it said.
AACo chief financial officer Luisa Catanzaro said trading conditions werebeing affected by a number of external events, such as the mad cow diseaseoutbreak in Japan, which have caused cattle prices to retreat from the highlevels of late 2001.
&quot;However, the market remains in advance of prices achieved at the start ofthe financial year,&quot; she said.
AACo shares rose 5c to 93c.

			<TEXT>AACo might have lost the injunction, but there are questions to be answered   
ONE part of Justice Ronald Sackville&apos;s Stanbroke Pastoral judgment might concern investors: he concluded there was a serious issue to be tried as to whether AMP lied about the issues it took into consideration in determining the successful bidder.   
Australian Agricultural Co, which lost the tender to the Nebo syndicate, alleged it had been misled into believing that the highest price was the determining factor, whereas preserving Stanbroke as an ongoing concern was also a major consideration.   
A press release by AMP Henderson Global gave support to that contention by stating many considerations were taken into account, including &quot;bidders&apos; intent to preserve Stanbroke as a separate entity&quot;.   
But under cross-examination AMP Henderson&apos;s Marcus Derwin, who handled the sale, said the release was &quot;factually incorrect&quot; and the primary consideration was &quot;price, price, price&quot;. The reference to preserving Stanbroke was to reassure its employees.   
&quot;If Mr Derwin&apos;s evidence is to be accepted it reflects little credit on AMP, since it means that a false statement was knowingly included in a media release in order to create a favourable impression in the minds of Stanbroke employees and presumably the public at large,&quot; Sackville said.   
That could add to AMP&apos;s long-standing and well-earned credibility problem where disclosure is concerned. Quite simply, can investors trust public statements by AMP?   
Sackville said there was clearly a serious issue to be tried on whether Nebo&apos;s intention to preserve Stanbroke as a separate entity was a factor in the final decision to accept that syndicate&apos;s offer.   
Unfortunately for Australian Agricultural Co, the losing tenderer, he decided that in the overall context, it wasn&apos;t a serious issue. Sackville&apos;s interpretation was that keeping Stanbroke as a separate entity was only to be taken into account where the competing bids were substantially equivalent in price, as was the case.   
He said Derwin didn&apos;t suggest otherwise and there was nothing in the bid documentation or AMP&apos;s internal deliberation process that suggested preservation of Stanbroke was a factor that would override price or detract from achieving the best price.   
Sackville ruled AACo had failed to establish there was a serious issue to be tried as to whether representations about the tender had been misleading or deceptive, or that AMP had breached alleged implied terms of the Process Contract.   
He therefore declined to grant an injunction to prevent the sale of Stanbroke other than by way of repeating the tender offer. AMP Life is now free to complete the sale to the successful tenderer, the Nebo syndicate.   
AACo will consider whether to seek damages against AMP. If it does, evidence will be viewed in a wider context. And AACo would consider issues which appeared to receive little, or no, consideration in Sackville&apos;s decision.   
High on that list would be the claim the Nebo offer won because it was less conditional than AAC&apos;s, in particular it didn&apos;t have the MAC (material adverse change) condition included by AACo -- that the deal could be called off if there was a material limitation of trading in all securities listed on the ASX. New York Stock Exchange or the London Stock Exchange, or the S&amp;P ASX 2000 index fell 10 per cent in any one day before completion.   
But that ignores the fact that Nebo&apos;s financier, Rabobank (its corporate arm also advised AMP on the transaction) contained a MAC clause as a standard term, and that it was potentially more onerous than that of AACo.   
It specified that Rabobank could decline a drawdown if the bank considered there had been a material adverse change from the circumstances disclosed in the application in the financial position, or projected financial position, of the borrower or a security provider, or the value of any security given or required, or the borrower&apos;s ability to repay the the facility.   
At the time of the September 5 deadline AACo had the highest bid -- $420 million plus Stanbroke&apos;s debt, compared to Nebo&apos;s $417.5 million plus debt. AACo considered it was taking on debt of $81 million whereas Nebo considered it was $73 million. AACo raised its offer to $460 million plus debt -- before Nebo paid a deposit, but AMP ruled that offer was too late.   
Rabobank conceded that at September 5 AACo had the highest offer, but recommended Nebo. Both bids needed the consent of the Northern Territory&apos;s Lands Minister. Rabobank suggested there may be a commercial reason for the Minister to give consent, but there could be adverse political pressure, given AACo&apos;s extensive land holding in the NT, with the risk of delays in completion.   
But Derwin was advised in June that the minister saw the transfer of Stanbroke as in NT&apos;s interest, and in late August he got a press report in which the minister&apos;s policy adviser denied AACo might be blocked, calling it &quot;a beat up&quot; and &quot;nonsense&quot;.   
Despite that, Sackville found there was no basis to contend the MAC clause could not have genuinely played any part in AMP&apos;s assessment of AAC&apos;s bid. He said the fact the Minister&apos;s consent was not obtained until September 22 suggested strongly the concerns expressed about the scope of the MAC clause &quot;had a solid foundation&quot; in a potentially volatile international situation.   
Yet AACo considered the risk of rejection by the NT Government so slight, it offered to significantly reduce the completion risk posed by the MAC clause by completing the transaction by September 11, thus putting the entire $420 million at its risk, and removing that risk from AMP.   
Derwin accepted Nebo&apos;s offer before obtaining performance guarantees from the Nebo shareholders. Those guarantees were to be joint and several -- if one party defaulted, the others could be called upon to make up the difference.   
But Nebo crossed out jointly in the final offer form, so each shareholder would only be up for their specified percentage, and that was accepted by Derwin. Remarkably, Sackville considered that to be only a &quot;minor&quot; amendment.

			<TEXT>AAC chief&apos;s pay rise  
AUSTRALIAN Agricultural Company (AAC) chief executive Peter Holmes a Court received a total pay package, excluding options, of $548,146 during 2002-03, compared to $532,198 previously. Mr Holmes a Court, who will be in court today for a ruling on its attempt to block the sale of AMP&apos;s Stanbroke cattle empire, has 6.2 million options outstanding but 1.2 million options lapsed during the year because he did not meet performance targets. AAC posted a net profit of $18.3 million for 2002-03, down from $20.6 million the previous year.  
Gunns&apos; big gun bonus  
JOHN Gay, executive chairman of controversial forestry group Gunns, took home $828,140 last financial year, including a bonus of $135,600. Gunns, Tasmania&apos;s biggest listed company, reported a 39 per cent rise in full-year net profit for the year to $74 million. Mr Gay also has an interest in 4.4 million shares, worth $56 million at yesterday&apos;s closing price of $12.78.  
Globe pays for mistake  
GLOBE International, the troubled skateboard and youth apparel manufacturer controlled by skateboard champions Peter and Steven Hill, paid out $851,482 to two former chief executives and a chairman last year as its ill-judged foray into the US backfired. Long-time chief executive Rob Hershan, who resigned on October 31, topped the payouts, taking $322,396 in salary, $88,852 in superannuation and $110,900 in options for a total $517,148.  
Millionaire&apos;s club  
TONY Palmer&apos;s successful stewardship of Newcrest Mining has kept him in the millionaires&apos; club in the past year, despite a modest fall in his total pay. The Newcrest annual report released yesterday revealed Mr Palmer took home $1.01 million for the year. Of that, $720,000 was his salary, with incentive payments and options added on.  
That was less than his $1.08 million for the preceding nine months, even though profitability has turned around. The directors gave themselves a raise. Non-executive chairman Ian Johnson&apos;s package rose from $218,292 to $275,853.  
Brown&apos;s $1m benefits  
LONG-serving Coates managing director Jim Brown, who stepped down earlier this year, collected almost $1 million in retirement benefits. The Coates annual report reveals that Mr Brown, who spent 35 years with Coates, including 20 as managing director, was paid $1.54 million last year, including $942,247 in accrued annual leave, long-service leave and retirement benefits.

			<TEXT>AMP    
AMP. It was a case of another week, another spot fire at AMP, with the insurer postponing the release of its demerger explanatory memorandum and, yesterday, being forced by the courts to suspend the sale of its Stanbroke Pastoral rural empire. Instead of lodging the long-awaited demerger document with the regulator yesterday as planned, AMP will now do so in &quot;early October&quot;. The stock rose 5c to $6.70 yesterday to end steady on the week.    
Foster&apos;s Group    
FGL. Corporate activity at Foster&apos;s has reignited interest in the premium beverages group, distracting attention from eroding wine margins as the industry deals with a global surplus and heavy discounting. Foster&apos;s has hired Goldman Sachs, JB Were and Credit Suisse First Boston to examine capital management options after the company said it would raise up to $881 million from the sale of its Australian Leisure and Hospitality unit.    
Brambles    
BIL. Global pallet producer Brambles worked hard yesterday to downplay speculation that the company was in talks over a possible takeover. The stock closed on Thursday at $4.92 and reopened yesterday at $5.10 because of the speculation. However, it soon went backwards as Brambles explained it wasn&apos;t conducting discussions with potential bidders. The damage was contained and the stock closed 6c weaker at $4.86.    
Roc Oil    
ROC. One of the few Australian-listed oil companies with production revenue from overseas, Roc Oil is keen to maximise its 2.6 per cent stake in the Chinguetti oil field off Mauritania. That may explain some minor tensions among the Chinguetti partners after Roc jumped the gun on Thursday, telling the market the latest drilling results. Woodside, the Chinguetti operator, said it would be three weeks before it had a handle on how well Chinguetti-4-5 had gone.    
AACo    
AAC. Peter Holmes a Court&apos;s Australian Agricultural Co failed to buy AMP&apos;s massive rural property empire, Stanbroke Pastoral Co, despite claims that it offered $541 million, a higher price than the $490 million winning bid from Nebo Holdings, a syndicate of wealthy families. AACo has now launched legal action against AMP to overturn the result. AMP gave an undertaking yesterday the sale would not be completed until the court hearing on Wednesday.    
Indcor    
ICO. Giant construction group Multiplex (itself about to float on the stock market) has backed its ethanol interests into listed Perth-based minnow Indcor, which will take over the planned Swan Hill ethanol refinery. Indcor chairman Peter Anderton said the deal involved Indcor paying out a loan of $1.5 million that Multiplex subsidiary Australian Biofuels owed its parent. Multiplex is Indcor&apos;s biggest shareholder, with around 28 per cent.

			<TEXT>* Litigation   
AMP&apos;S hopes for a clean sale of its vast rural property empire, Stanbroke Pastoral Co, were dashed yesterday when Peter Holmes a Court&apos;s Australian Agricultural Co launched legal action to overturn the result.   
AACo, which was unsuccessful in last week&apos;s tender, claims it offered more than the winning bidder, the Nebo syndicate, in the three stages of the sale. AACo also claims it was not given access to the same information about the bidding process for the Stanbroke properties managed by AMP for its life insurance customers.   
It seeks to have the sale process conducted again under independent supervision determined by the court, or damages and compensation for &quot;the loss of opportunity to make profits&quot;.   
On Tuesday last week AMP announced the sale of Stanbroke&apos;s 11.7 million hectares in western Queensland and the Northern Territory to the Nebo syndicate for $490 million.   
But according to documents lodged yesterday in the Federal Court, AACo -- the second largest pastoral company after Stanbroke -- had offered $541 million (including debt) for Stanbroke on the day before the sale closed.   
AACo&apos;s case rests on whether AMP maximised the value of Stanbroke to policy holders, as stated several times during the sale process, which commenced at the start of the year.   
In documents lodged with the Federal Court in Sydney yesterday, AACo claimed it was &quot;prejudiced unfairly in its bid by the denial of the disclosure of relevant and significant criteria&quot; for the sale.   
AACo claimed AMP had wanted the 27 properties in Stanbroke to be run as an independent entity.   
AACo, which has several properties adjoining Stanbroke properties, wanted to obtain economies of scale by combining the Stanbroke properties with its own wherever possible.   
&quot;The respondents (AMP) knew that AACo proposed a merging of its business with that of Stanbroke,&quot; AACo claimed. &quot;But at no time did they inform AACo that such an intention was ... relevant to its evaluation of the tender, or that a tender disclosing such an intention would be regarded less favourably than a tender disclosing an intention to maintain Stanbroke as an independent business.&quot;   
AACo also claims that Peter Hughes -- spokesman for the Nebo syndicate -- had information about Stanbroke he had obtained through being a director of the company since 1988.   
Earlier this week Mr Hughes said the prospect of legal action would not cause him to lose any sleep, as everything was done &quot;very straight down the line, no worries&quot;.   
&quot;As soon as AMP announced it (Stanbroke) was on the market, I took leave of absence and had no further contact with any part of Stanbroke,&quot; he said. &quot;After that I was just one of the mob trying to buy.&quot;

			<TEXT>RURAL   
Families who bought a pastoral giant can&apos;t see any changes in store, writes Fiona Cameron   
THE mammoth Stanbroke Pastoral Co will continue to be run as is.   
There had been no consideration of bringing any of the purchasers&apos; own extensive cattle-station interests under the control of Stanbroke, says its former director and new joint owner, Peter Hughes.   
&quot;The people who are in it, they have their families and they are doing their own thing and they will be able to continue to do their own thing,&quot; he says. &quot;This is just a separate investment.&quot;   
Hughes put the $490 million bid together with vegetable grower and cattleman Peter Menegazzo and the support of three other Queensland rural families.   
Investor Jack Cowin, who runs 200 Hungry Jack&apos;s hamburger stores in Australia, joined the Nebo bid when final offers were lodged for Stanbroke on September 1.   
Staff and management were relieved their jobs were safe and that the empire was not destined to be sold off in pieces, as some bidders proposed.   
Stanbroke managing director John Cox says it was a tough few months for Stanbroke staff, and some have been poached by other companies.   
&quot;I feel like I&apos;ve been managing people more than livestock in the past few months.&quot;   
Cox says he has known Stanbroke&apos;s new majority owner, Peter Menegazzo for some time as a neighbour, because Menagazzo&apos;s Van Rook station adjoins the Stanbroke property, Miranda, at Karumba in the Gulf.   
&quot;I don&apos;t foresee any major changes,&quot; Cox says. &quot;I think we will be sticking to the fundamentals of low-cost production, sustainable development and conservative rangeland management.&quot;   
Disappointment was enormous among the unsuccessful bidders, with one considering legal action.   
Hughes says the talk of legal action is not causing him to lose any sleep, as everything was done &quot;very straight down the line, no worries&quot;.   
&quot;As soon as AMP announced it (Stanbroke) was on the market, I took leave of absence and had no further contact with any part of Stanbroke,&quot; he says. &quot;After that I was just one of the mob trying to buy.&quot;   
The deal is subject to approval from the Northern Territory minister for Infrastructure, Planning and Environment, Kon Vatskalis, as the transfer of more than 13,000sqkm there requires special consent.   
Hughes says his consortium is confident of winning that approval, although he says he cannot pre-empt the Minister&apos;s decision.   
Nebo approached the Northern Territory Government during the tender campaign, and will be sending a delegation to Darwin again soon, he says.   
In relation to the price paid for Stanbroke, Hughes hints that the Nebo consortium maybe spent more than it expected.   
&quot;We believe it&apos;s a fair price,&quot; he says. &quot;Whenever you buy something you always seem to have to pay more than you want, but if they&apos;re quality properties, the values soon catch up.&quot;   
Herron Todd White valuers chairman Kerry Herron says the price paid for Stanbroke seems &quot;bullish&quot;, although there is some mystery over how the company&apos;s debt is being handled in the deal, exact settlement terms and some tax issues.   
Herron says cattle station prices have been pushed to record levels in recent years by astute cattlemen, and the buyers &quot;are astute cattlemen themselves&quot;.   
&quot;It&apos;s an aggregation of name properties, and even individually they are hard to come by, at any time,&quot; Herron says.   
&quot;This group covers a wide geographic area, so the risk from seasons and markets is spread. The management is in place and the cattle are on the ground, producing money from day one. There is no interruption to the cash flow.&quot; Nonetheless the price paid for Stanbroke is &quot;fully firm on past sales&quot;, says Herron.   
A rush of sales could be expected now, with the failed bidders having finance in place and being in a mood to buy, he says. Underbidder Australian Agricultural Co Ltd declined to comment on the deal, saying it is still restricted by the terms of the tender.   
Stanbroke was formed in 1964 as the rural investment arm of the AMP Society. It now covers 11.7 million hectares on 27 aggregations in the Northern Territory and Queensland, and runs more than 500,000 head of cattle.

There&apos;s no stampede for Stanbroke as the territory Government warns it could block bids, writes Fiona Cameron   
THE Northern Territory Government has the power to stymie a bid for the $400 million Stanbroke Pastoral empire.   
So far, only one of the eight final bidders has detailed its offer to the territory Government.   
The Government can invoke legislation vetoing any bidder with more than 13,000sqkm of Northern Territory pastoral land from buying more of the territory.   
Stanbroke Pastoral spans 36,171sqkm across 27 stations in the NT and Queensland -- an area almost twice the size of Tasmania.   
The legislation could affect potential bidder Australian Agricultural Co Ltd, which owns a swag of NT stations. Lesley Cameron, policy adviser to NT Infrastructure, Planning and Environment minister Kon Vatskalis, says only one bidder has approached the minister&apos;s office.   
Vatskalis was in Greece this week and plans to be away until after the September 1 deadline for final bids in the Stanbroke sale.   
He was due to be joined in Greece this week by NT chief minister Clare Martin.   
Sources suggest Vatskalis is not in favour of allowing AACo to buy Stanbroke, given its already significant holdings on the Barkly Tablelands.   
But Cameron says the minister has no such view and &quot;still has to form an opinion&quot;. Whoever wanted to buy Stanbroke would have to make a presentation to the Government.   
&quot;They would have to come up to us with briefs. We would need a full briefing,&quot; she says.   
The one approach so far to the minister was on an informal basis, and not from AACo, Cameron says.   
Sources have told The Australian that Stanbroke bidders who already hold NT pastoral land &quot;may well face an obstacle&quot; to their bids in the Northern Territory Pastoral Lands Act.   
Section 34 provides that a person, either alone or with associates, may not hold more than 13,000sqkm of pastoral land, but the minister can override this &quot;in the interest of the Territory&quot;.   
&quot;It is understood the NT Government would be concerned to see under ownership/management and control such large areas of this prime country,&quot; an industry source says.   
Cameron says this is not the case, and a policy and opinion will be formed on the basis of any applications.   
Some of Australia&apos;s best pastoral real estate -- a swathe of land considered the best Barkly Tablelands savannah or downs country -- would be held by one company if AACo buys Stanbroke.   
AACo is considered one of the leading bidders for Stanbroke, with strong bids also coming from Alice Springs Pastoral Co and Washington H. Soul Pattinson, and at least three others.   
Stanbroke holds 36,171sqkm in the territory, and AACo holds 25,450sqkm.   
A successful bid from AACo would boost the size of the company&apos;s holdings in the NT to 61,621sqkm, provided the minister allowed it to proceed.   
Asked whether AACo had approached the NT Government, AACo managing director Don Mackay said the ongoing Stanbroke sale process restricted him from making any comment.

BEEF producer the Australian Agricultural Company is looking forward to storm clouds on the horizon and has forecast that improved pastoral conditions in the next year will add up to 25 per cent to its bottom line.   
AACo yesterday reported a net profit of $18.3 million for the year to the end of June, down 11.2 per cent from the $20.6 million recorded in the previous year.   
It said the drought was the main reason for the drop in profit, saying it had affected the cattle condition but not caused an actual drop in herd numbers.   
Most of AACo&apos;s holdings are in the Channel country of western Queensland, but some are in the Northern Territory, and the company also operates two feedlots in Queensland.   
Chief executive Peter Holmes a Court said the company&apos;s ability to move stock between its properties was one reason it was able to minimise the impact of the drought.   
&quot;Not all of our properties were equally affected -- the Northern Territory wasn&apos;t that bad -- and we obtained good dividends from our feedlot operations,&quot; he said.   
But the company is anticipating a 15-20 per cent increase in net profit in the coming year on the basis of more stock and more rainfall leading to better conditions in its holdings.   
&quot;We believe we have been through the worst of it,&quot; Mr Holmes a Court said.   
&quot;Already in some parts of the Channel country we have had rain this year whereas we hadn&apos;t at the same time last year. We are expecting a bit more rain over the next few months, but we should also have a wet season this year, which we didn&apos;t have last year.&quot;   
Japan recently increased its tariffs on beef from Australia by 11.5 per cent, a measure that will stay in place until the end of March next year, but Mr Holmes a Court said so far this had no effect on the company.   
He pointed out that Japanese companies such as Nippon Beef, which had processing facilities in Australia, would pay the extra tariff, as would US companies operating in Australia, such as Australian Meat Holdings.   
AACo also invested in several value-adding activities during the year, the main one being the Jesters pie chain, which operates 30 pie shops through franchises in Western Australia.   
&quot;We opened the first one in Melbourne last week, and plan to roll them out through NSW and Queensland over the coming year,&quot; Mr Holmes a Court said.

			<TEXT>RURAL It is blue sky time and big money is being put on the property line,writes Fiona Cameron STANBROKE Pastoral Co, Australian Agricultural Co,Consolidated Pastoral and Kidman Holdings are among the big names in beefproduction.
But even as a combined force, the biggest corporate players and theirmillion-plus head of cattle are responsible for less than 10 per cent of thenation&apos;s beef output.
The much larger group of producers is the sector privately owned and run byfamilies, individuals and syndicates.
And as a group, they are increasingly making a name for themselves as cannyand aggressive market players, out-bidding the corporates when it comes tosecuring properties they want.
The private operators are seen as the driving force behind the continual newhighs the cattle property market has reached in the past two years, and theyare even giving the corporates a run for their money in the current biddingin the $400 million-plus sell-off of Stanbroke Pastoral Co.
The present rural property market is a &quot;feeding frenzy&quot;, according to HerronTodd White Valuers chairman Kerry Herron.
This has been fuelled partially by aggressive lending and low interestrates, but also by lower debt and good returns in the cattle industry inrecent years.
Herron says there are at least eight family or privately owned cattleoperators that could spend $10 million on a property.
Central Queensland has been a focus of activity and is perhaps overheating,he says, with the dry weather and the rising Australian dollar likely totest the market.
Individual cattlemen and families are dominant among rural property buyers,Herron says.
&quot;Collectively, they&apos;re a potent force,&quot; he says.
Many of the big cattle families - the Actons, McDonalds and McClymonts - arewell known in rural circles. But there are many others, too, among the bigprivate operators, including names such as Brian Oxenford, Ashley Daly, TomBrinkworth, Charles Lund, John Quintana as well as the Harris, Pedracini,Dunnicliff, Appleton, Cowan, Hughes and Brook families.
&quot;The main strength of the rural market in general and cattle propertyespecially in the past 12 months has been the private individuals andfamilies,&quot; says Primac Elders agent Andrew Adcock.
Lower interest rates are stimulating buyer activity in the private sector,as is good news in commodity prices and rural economies, he says.
&quot;I think what we are seeing is more family members prepared to return home,&quot;Adcock says.
&quot;They can see some blue sky in rural industries that this time looks like itcan be sustained. Although there&apos;s been some pressure on commodity prices,generally it has been good news and so family members can see a future inreturning home to the land.&quot;
Primac Elders recently ran the marketing campaign and auction for threeQueensland properties owned by grazier Sinclair Hill, a private operator whohimself has run a significant string of cattle stations in Queensland andNSW.
The $15 million-plus offering was the biggest rural listing in Queenslandthis year, and it was no surprise when all three properties sold at auctionto private cattle families for healthy prices.
The trend had been happening for some time, and it seems many of the privateoperators are not restrained by lack of capital.
The tables have turned so much that it seems whenever there is a bigcorporate offering or dispersal, there is no shortage of private buyerswilling to jump in and take up the opportunity.
The $200 million National Mutual Rural Enterprises sell-off in recent yearsproved such a case and many of its assets went to smaller, private buyers.
This did not include its cotton assets though: in an industry that isdominated by big companies rather than individuals, its cotton propertieswent to a corporate buyer.
Stanbroke is well aware of the value of the private dollar.
Last year it offered for sale its 901,000ha Queensland Gulf cattle stationStrathmore and auctioneers took about 60 bids from six keen parties, withbidding rising from $11 million to the sale price of $15.35 million.
The successful bidder was Dale Appleton and family, who run BulliwallahStation south of Charters Towers. The sale of Strathmore, 124km north-westof Georgetown, included 18,000 head of brahman cattle.
Strathmore had previously changed hands in 1988 when Stanbroke bought it for$3 million from the Coutts brothers.
Stanbroke managing director John Cox said at the time that Strathmore wasbeing sold because, with Stanbroke also owning the nearby station MirandaDowns, there was no point building up two Gulf operations side by side.
However, the sale was also no doubt a useful litmus test for Stanbroke andits owner AMP Life on the state of the market for such big-ticket offerings.
With Strathmore selling for more than $3 million above its reserve, it wasan indication that money was out there and people were keen to buy.
That no doubt was a big factor in the decision announced in April that theentire Stanbroke portfolio would be offered for sale in one line.
The shortlist of bidders that has since been drawn up is understood toinclude at least two syndicates of big private buyers, although there couldbe some overlap among partners.
Herron says confidence is high in the rural property market on the back ofgood cattle prices and good seasons in some areas, with pure &quot;grass&quot; salesstill taking place in north Queensland.
Maiden Springs at Hughenden recently sold for $3.8 million and had beenbought just for its grass, as it had received 70mm of rain just before theauction, he says.
The cattle barons * ACTON: Brothers Evan and Graeme have built up theirActon Land and Cattle Co since the 1980s, and have four Queenslandproperties. Cattle: 85,000.
* McDONALD: Dynasty led by Jim McDonald, 95, and sons Bob and Don, of 11Queensland properties. In 1997 they bought the Stanbroke Station nearCloncurry for about $4m. Cattle: 130,000.
* McCLYMONT: Malcolm McClymont has five Queensland properties. Cattle:40,000; His brother Alister is understood to run more than 30,000 cattle.
* ARABURY PASTORAL: Ashley Daley runs his operation on four properties inQueensland&apos;s Channel Country. Cattle: 60,000.
* GAMBAMORA: Brian Oxenfords Northern Territory and Queensland operationcovers seven properties. Cattle: 100,000.
* HUGHES: Headed by Stanbroke director Peter Hughes on the family&apos;s eightQld properties. Cattle: More than 20,000.

			<TEXT>RURAL Just the bullish will survive first-round Stanbroke bids, writes FionaCameron ONLY the most serious bidders for Stanbroke Pastoral Co will be atthe negotiating table after tomorrow&apos;s close of first-round bids.
AMP is setting a cracking pace for the disposal of its iconic cattlecompany, and shortlisted bidders will be notified next Friday before thesecond round of the sale process begins just three days later.
But the publicly stated conditions for the first round of offers are sorigorous that only a handful of bidders is likely to make it to stage two.
Sale co-ordinator Rabobank is not saying who has lodged bids, howeverseveral companies have publicly declared their interest, includingAustralian Agricultural Co, Alice Springs Pastoral Co and a syndicate headedby Stanbroke director Peter Hughes.
Others have been more circumspect, as smaller players seek alliances amongparties that could come in on a deal, with plans to split the assets betweenthem.
Sources say though that these syndicates have been proving enormouslydifficult to put together, giving a key edge to the bigger playersespecially considering the short time frame available for packaging anoffer.
The McDonald and Acton families in Queensland, and possibly theAdelaide-based S. Kidman &amp; Co, are among those known to be interested inparts of the Stanbroke portfolio, but maybe not the entire company as isStanbroke parent AMP Life&apos;s stated preference for the sale.
Businessman Kerry Packer&apos;s Consolidated Pastoral has been touted as a likelybidder, but sources say any Packer bid is more likely to come through itsGRM International rather than from Consolidated.
Ken Warriner is the head of both companies, and if he puts forward a Packerbid, it will be up against one steered by his son, David Warriner, who isgeneral manager of Alice Springs Pastoral Co.
ASP, the Australian rural empire run by Greek shipping tycoon GregoryHadjieleftheriadis, is understood to have found two other parties to come inon its bid, but was seeking one more late last week.
US businessman Ted Turner has been tipped as a possible bidder, especiallyfollowing his sale last week of half his AOL Time Warner shares for $US789million ($1.2 billion).
After Turner&apos;s resignation as Time AOL chairman in January, insiders said hewas planning to &quot;retire and raise buffalo&quot;.
Market analysts say AMP appointed the Holland-based Rabobank in order tooptimise the chances of locating international buyers.
AACo chief Peter Holmes a Court has railed against the idea of Stanbrokegoing to a foreign buyer, but analysts are not ruling it out at this stage.
Sensitive as it is, a spokeswoman for federal Treasurer Peter Costello (whooversees the Foreign Investment Review Board) told The Australian last monththat the Government would make no comment on the matter of the possibleforeign ownership of Stanbroke until after any deal was approved andfinalised.
However, insiders point to Costello&apos;s surprise decision two years ago toblock the $10 billion merger between Woodside Petroleum and Royal DutchShell, after national interest arguments were put by Woodside, and say thedilemmas surrounding the sale of Australian assets offshore are matters withwhich Costello is familiar.
Stanbroke&apos;s accounts show that its cattle have a book value of about $227million and the company has total assets of about $399 million. Withliabilities of about $150 million, it has net assets of about $250 million.
The Rabobank memorandum says: &quot;AMP Henderson believes there is significantvalue inherent in the integrated system developed and managed by theStanbroke management team and employees.&quot;
It says Stanbroke &quot;is the largest producer of beef cattle in Australia andamong the largest producers of grass-fed beef cattle in the world&quot;.
Its diversity and scale of properties allows operational efficiency andflexibility, &quot;making Stanbroke one of the world&apos;s lowest-cost producers ofbeef with substantial scope for managing risks such as drought&quot;.
The company had about 485,000 head of cattle at December last year, afterdeclining from a peak of approximately 550,000 in 2001 &quot;due to one of theworst droughts in Australia for over 100 years&quot;.
As well as the 27 cattle stations across Queensland and the NorthernTerritory, the sale of Stanbroke will also include a 59 per centshareholding in the Valley Beef Company, the owner of the Grantham abattoir,a retail outlet in Brisbane and a domestic and international meat marketingdivision responsible for Stanbroke&apos;s Diamantina branded product range.
The company has 435 staff: 32 in the Brisbane head office and 403 on thestations.
Rabobank says at the outset that the information memorandum is provided for&quot;parties considering making an offer for 100 per cent of Stanbroke&quot;.However, it later invites parties to lodge non-conforming bids,&quot;particularly if they believe an alternative structure could increase thenet proceeds offered to AMP Life&quot;.
&quot;For example, a bidder for 100 per cent of Stanbroke shares may nominateproperties that they would prefer to not acquire and the impact this wouldhave on their offer,&quot; the document says. Bidders who make it to the stagetwo shortlist will have access to a due diligence process, and will havealready lodged extensive information about themselves and their bid.
After the due diligence is completed though, there&apos;ll be no turning back.Rabobank says at this stage, shortlisted bidders will be required to lodge&quot;an unconditional fully funded binding offer&quot;.
AMP has reserved its right though to accept non-conforming offers onindividual properties and to sell them separately to the rest of theportfolio &quot;in order to maximise its overall proceeds&quot;.
Alice Springs Pastoral owner Gregory Hadjieleftheriadis is understood tohave returned to Athens last week, leaving a team of accountants hereworking on his bid.
In in a recent interview with The Australian he said he could not resistmaking a bid for Stanbroke.
&quot;Who could not be interested to buy such a jewel in the crown of Australia&apos;spastoral industry?&quot; Hadjieleftheriadis said.
Acknowledging the numerous parties vying for the pastoral giant, he said: &quot;Isee it as a bit like the Olympic Games in Athens. Let the Games begin!&quot;Under the Alice Springs bid, existing Stanbroke management and structurewould be retained, and Hadjieleftheriadis says he has plans for the companyto move into organic beef production.

			<TEXT>* Agribusiness COWS-to-pies group Australian Agricultural Co remainedtight-lipped yesterday on whether it would bid for AMP&apos;s vast Stanbrokecattle empire.
AACo chief executive Peter Holmes a Court said it would be &quot;commerciallysilly&quot; and a breach of confidentiality to comment on any deal - effectivelyconfirming that AACo is interested in the company&apos;s 27 properties in theNorthern Territory and Queensland.
The Stanbroke Pastoral Co was put on the market by AMP in April and isexpected to fetch more than $400 million. Bids close on May 16 when ashortlist of preferred bidders will be drawn up.
Mr Holmes a Court reiterated that AACo, Australia&apos;s oldest cattle business,had &quot;considerable acquisition capacity&quot; and was on the lookout to boost thesize of its existing herd of 378,000 cattle spread across 14 millionhectares of northern Australia.
He also said the company had a low debt gearing of 30-35 per cent. Heconfirmed that he personally had a &quot;large appetite&quot; for acquisitions.
The question is whether AACo considers Stanbroke&apos;s 485,000-strong herd and11.7 million hectares as the &quot;prudent&quot; investment it has pledged to deliverto its shareholders.
Stanbroke reported a net loss of $9.26 million last financial year, afterits herd was devalued by $31 million. Nevertheless, it managed to pay AMP afully franked dividend of $43 million.
Mr Holmes a Court said AACo, which recently diversified into making pies,had booked earnings before interest and tax of $21.1 million for the ninemonths to March 2003, down 8 per cent on the previous corresponding period.
He said the drought-affected figures revealed a &quot;relative improvement&quot; onthe half-year result.
&quot;You may remember (at the half year) that we were down 80 per cent on theprevious corresponding period,&quot; he said.
He attributed the improvement to stronger prices and higher volumes,stemming from rains across northern Australia which had improved conditionson many, but not all, of AACo&apos;s properties.
AACo revised its forecast slightly upwards for full-year net profit. Itpredicts a loss of $20.6 million, down 10 per cent on the 2002 result.
AACo shares closed at 93c, down 2c.

			<TEXT>Beef over Stanbroke STANBROKE Pastoral Co is on the sales block and would-besuitor Australian Agricultural Co has spoken out against the company fallinginto foreign hands. Its holdings cover an area almost twice the size ofTasmania.
ITK wonders if it niggles AACo&apos;s Peter Holmes a Court that Stanbroke&apos;s firstdeclared foreign suitor, Greek shipping tycoon Gregory Hadjieleftheriadis,already owns Glenprairie Station in the Northern Territory. Glenprairie waswhere Holmes a Court and wife Divonne chose to exchange their vows in 1995,when it was still owned by Heytesbury Beef.
But no-one is underestimating the seriousness of the Greek bid forStanbroke. Two years ago, Hadjieleftheriadis appointed David Warriner tohead his Australian operations, which focus on two former Vestey propertiesnear Rockhampton, and Glenprairie. Warriner is a well-known name in ruralcircles: David&apos;s father Ken is the long-time manager of Kerry Packer&apos;ssuccessful Consolidated Pastoral cattle operations.
Hannans oust Packer AND speaking of Mr Packer, ITK hears that the mediamogul has lost out in a little publishing and property stoush. Packer&apos;s NDCmagazine distribution arm has been leasing a building in Alexandria foryears. The problem is the O&apos;Riordon Street property is owned by rival Hannanfamily. Hannan&apos;s Independent Print Media rubbed Packer up the wrong way inwinning a publishing contract for the glossy Vogue in Australia and for itsambitious publishing and printing expansion plans. Mr Packer was apparentlyasked to &quot;please leave the building&quot; when the Hannans found out that NDChadn&apos;t signed a lease since 1996. NDC has apparently found a home somewheredown the road.
`Centro syndrome&apos; FORGET SARS, institutional investors in the listedproperty trust are suffering from a bad case of &quot;Centro syndrome&quot;. Thoseinvestors who happily sold into Centro&apos;s $1.60-a-unit move on AMP ShoppingCentre Trust were unimpressed when Westfield weighed in and paid $1.80 aunit for its 19.9 per cent stake.
Stockland Trust Group found institutions were once bitten twice shy when ittried to build its 19.9 per cent stake in AMP Diversified: its first bid of$2.90 wasn&apos;t enough to win them over, but $2.95 convinced some to sell. Now,ITK hears that nervous trust managers are building defensive stakes in theirown vehicles, to ward off potential predators. Wonder what the institutionswill make of that.
Manager, tower to be CONSTRUCTION won&apos;t even start on the tower at Sydney&apos;s126 Phillip Street until May this year, but Principal Office Fund hasalready appointed East Asia Property Group to manage it. Principal&apos;s ChrisWaggett says he wants the property manager for the tower, with Deutsche Bankas key tenant, involved from the ground up.

			<TEXT>RURAL This rural sale which could pour up to $500 million into AMP&apos;s coffershas not wanted for eager buyers from around the globe, writes Fiona CameronAMP Life was rushed with expressions of interest last week after offeringfor sale its Stanbroke Pastoral Co, the nation&apos;s biggest cattle producer andlandholder.
The only would-be buyer to declare his hand, Greek shipping tycoon GregoryHadjieleftheriadis, told The Australian he was putting together a bidcomprising himself and several Australian partners. He plans to introduce anorganic stream of production into the cattle giant and keep Stanbroke as asingle entity.
Brisbane property agent Lex Heinemann of Ray White Rural is working on theGreek tycoon&apos;s bid - being made through Alice Springs Pastoral Co - but alsois working with another syndicate that wants to buy Stanbroke and then splitits 27 properties among as many as 15 different owners.
Stanbroke director Peter Hughes reportedly is putting together a bid for thecompany, but has declined to comment on that, while Stanbroke&apos;s closestrival, the Australian Agricultural Co, has dismissed reports that it hasmade a bid for Stanbroke as &quot;entirely speculative&quot;.
But AACo acknowledges it will examine the offer. Chief executive PeterHolmes a Court previously has said he would like the company to have amillion head of cattle.
Announcing the tender sale last week, AMP Henderson&apos;s private capitaldirector of operations, Marcus Derwin, said the decision to sell had beenmade because of &quot;significant expressions of interest from a number ofparties, at a time when market conditions for a possible divestment arefavourable&quot;.
He noted Stanbroke is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMP Life and, as such, isowned by AMP Life policy-holders, not AMP Ltd shareholders.
AMP has not nominated any conditions or a closing date for the tender.
Analysts suggest Stanbroke could bring as much as $550 million for AMP, withits approximately 500,000 head of cattle estimated to be worth $250 millionalone.
Rabobank has been appointed to advise AMP on the tender process, but hasdeclined to comment.
Stanbroke was formed in 1964 but only knocked AACo from the position ofbiggest cattle producer six years ago, when it paid about $65 million forthe lion&apos;s share of the Bankers Trust Australia rural portfolio.
That deal delivered 110,000 head of cattle, and upped Stanbroke&apos;s herd by athird.
In 1997, AACo said it wanted to increase its herd to 500,000 head, a goal ithas not yet achieved.
Stanbroke&apos;s potential sale made news around the world, with reports on CNNand Bloomberg and in London&apos;s Financial Times within hours of theannouncement.
Dow Jones reported AACo had expressed an interest less than 24 hours afterthe offering, as did The Sydney Morning Herald.
AACo made its &quot;entirely speculative&quot; statement later that day. It said itmay express an interest &quot;depending on the terms of the tender and theoutcome of any review of the business that we undertake&quot;.
It won&apos;t be alone. With most of the cattle industry highly cashed up on theback of double-digit returns in the past three years, there is likely to bea flood of buyers.
Some analysts have questioned why AMP wants to sell the company in one line,as it could fetch high prices by splitting the assets.
But there is understood to be a significant stamp duty consideration, withbenefits in selling off the whole company, rather than its real estate andcattle assets.
There could also be public relations and political issues in simply pursuingthe best dollar value on the open market.
Queensland rural property agent Phil Black, of Philip Black Auctioneers,doesn&apos;t believe AMP will maximise its returns by selling Stanbroke in oneline.
He suggests a &quot;multi-parcel auction&quot;, allowing people to bid on all theproperties, or any lots, and in any combination.
&quot;It would open up Stanbroke to all types of buyers,&quot; he says.
Such an auction would take &quot;hours and hours&quot;, but is the only way to ensurethe best return for the company, he says.
Black this month negotiated Queensland&apos;s biggest rural property sale of theyear when he signed a deal, at the $8.5 million asking price, within threedays of listing the 67,178ha Muttaburra district Tower Hill/Cullodenaggregation.
He has used the &quot;multi-parcel&quot; auction technique several times and says hehas proved it works well.
&quot;It&apos;s a method where people bid simultaneously, and the auctioneer takesbids on any property, any group of properties or all lots,&quot; he says. &quot;Peoplecan raise their bids at any stage.&quot;

			<TEXT>* Agribusiness LOW prices caused by the drought sent earnings tumbling atcows-to-pies group Australian Agricultural Co, but it continues to forecastdouble-digit earnings growth next financial year.
AACo, which runs cattle stations in western Queensland as well as a varietyof value-adding activities, yesterday reported an 83 per cent slump in netprofit for the six months to the end of December, from $28.3 million to $3.8million.
The company&apos;s herd numbers have dropped 4 per cent from 408,000 at the endof 2001 to 393,000 at the end of last year, but chief executive Peter Holmesa Court said the main cause for the drop in profits was low cattle prices.
&quot;We had a surge in the corresponding period the year before, while for thisperiod they were very low,&quot; he said.
&quot;There were also a lot of cattle we had to sell before they were fullyfattened, and so they sold for less.&quot;
Mr Holmes a Court said that while the rains of the past week wereencouraging, even with a normal wet season the company still expected aresult this year 10-20 per cent below that of last year.
Given that last financial year the company recorded a profit of $20.6million, this would put this year&apos;s profit at somewhere between $16 millionand $18 million.
The market had factored in the negative effects of drought and yesterday&apos;sresult sent the shares just 1c lower to 88c.
But Mr Holmes a Court insisted the company was on track for good long-termgrowth, pointing out that the average value of a beast in the herd was $496,up from $466 recorded last year, but down from the $529 recorded at the endof 2001.
AACo&apos;s breeding herd had increased by 3 per cent to 191,000 over 2002 at atime when national breeding stocks had decreased by 3 per cent.
Mr Holmes a Court said that he expected cattle prices to continue toincrease for at least the rest of the year and this in turn would lead todouble-digit earnings growth in the next financial year.
&quot;I think we&apos;ve weathered the 100-year drought pretty well,&quot; he said.
&quot;We&apos;ve had a very encouraging start to the year and a considerable amount ofrain, but all the climate modelling we&apos;ve seen shows that the current wetseason will be a standard one.&quot;
At a glance AACo Half year 2002 2001 Ttl revenue ($m) 42.5 70.1 EBIT ($m)7.1 41.2 Net profit ($m) 3.8 28.1 EPS (c) 2 18 Share close $0.88 - .01.

			<TEXT>* Agribusiness PETER Holmes a Court&apos;s Australian Agricultural Co will usefood services company Bidvest to distribute its meat instead of its ownChefs Partners brand.
The AACo has 400,000 head of cattle in mostly outback locations anddistributes its meat to clubs and restaurants, rather than supplysupermarkets and other butchers who then retail it directly to the public.
Currently AACo distributes its products through Chefs Partners, of which itowns 45 per cent, and Mr Holmes a Court said yesterday that for manycustomers it would simply be a case of having a different van come with thesame goods.
&quot;What we&apos;re good at is producing meat, not driving vans around the country,&quot;said Mr Holmes a Court. &quot;Our involvement with the food chain stops when themeat hits the dock.&quot;
Mr Holmes a Court said that the move would better enable the company toguarantee a standard quality across the industry, regardless of where themeat came from.
&quot;You have to accept that there will be differences in quality because that&apos;sthe nature of the raw product,&quot; he said. &quot;But the stakes, so to speak, areso much higher for restaurants - if people get a good steak at a restaurant,then they&apos;re likely to come back, and if it&apos;s not good, they won&apos;t.&quot;
He said the demand for restaurant and takeaway food was growing, with 32c ofevery dollar spent on food in Australia being spent outside the home, whilein the US it was over 50c.
The companies said that they expected sales of the Chefs Partners and AACo&apos;spremium 1824 brand to exceed $100 million within four years.
Bidvest, a South African-based company with a large presence in Europe,operates as a distributor of other food products - such as fries and salads- to clubs and restaurants.
The move failed to excite the market, with AACo&apos;s shares dropping 1c to 98c.

THE decision to lift bans on US beef in Japan and South Korea is expected to weaken world beef prices this year, according to Australian Agricultural Company (AACo).  
At its annual general meeting in Brisbane yesterday, the beef producer confirmed earlier net profit forecasts of $22.2million for this financial year -- the same as the profit achieved in 2003-04.  
AACo chairman Nicholas Burton Taylor, who was unanimously re-elected at the meeting, said strong cattle prices during the year had helped the result, which was up 22 per cent on 2002-03.  
The company&apos;s first-quarter results were yet to be reported but were ahead of budget, Mr Burton Taylor said.  
&quot;However, our expectation is that an easing in beef prices is likely to moderate this improvement as US product gains re-entry into key Asian markets.&quot;  
He said an increase in wage costs and rising world oil prices had offset the full benefit of the strong beef prices during the year.  
Mr Burton Taylor also said the strengths of Australian beef -- such as strong quality assurance procedures and clean handling -- would help the local market ride out the expected &quot;short-term volatility&quot; that would result from the lift of the trading bans.  
Changing market demands and the increasing popularity of beef in the US would also bolster revenues.  
&quot;McDonald&apos;s in the US have advised that by the end of 2005 they will require 10 per cent of their total production to be sourced from those who can give full accountability for its source, origin and handling,&quot; Mr Burton Taylor said.  
&quot;This is going to lead to 100 per cent of their supply by the year 2007.&quot;  
Mr Burton Taylor also defended the legal action the company was undertaking against AMP after it lost a bidding war for cattle station empire Stanbroke Pastoral, which was sold by AMP in September last year.  
&quot;AACo is not being emotional or precious about its failure to acquire Stanbroke -- we were disappointed, yes, but we moved on from that a long time ago,&quot; he said.  
&quot;We are not being driven by opportunism in this overly litigious environment. We are motivated by what we believe is a serious lack of process and governance.&quot;  
AACo spent $83 million on land and cattle during the period and increased its breeding herd by 14 per cent to 189,000 head of cattle.  
The company bought Carrum Station in Queensland, which included about 58,000 cattle, for $50 million and paid $25 million for six properties near Surat, also in Queensland.  
AACo expanded its overall asset base by 20 per cent, taking net assets to $367.8 million, but divested $18 million of smaller properties in the period.  
AACo shares closed 1c down last night at $1.34.

			<TEXT>RURAL   
It has been a long and painful process, but native land rights deals are beginning to work, Asa Wahlquist reports   
THE Australian Agricultural Company, the biggest cattle producer in the country, last week signed a flagship memorandum of understanding with the local Waluwarra/Georgina people, in western Queensland.   
AAco head Don Mackay said it was a positive agreement because it &quot;clearly provides a proper framework to the relationship, to the process of access, and at the same time it puts a responsibility on us to ensure the preservation of any sites of importance&quot;.   
Chairperson of the Waluwarra Aboriginal Corporation, Marlene Speechley, said at the signing: &quot;We are very excited and believe this agreement is a great step towards reconciliation.&quot;   
The MoU covers the 1.2 million hectare Headingly Station, southwest of Mt Isa.   
Mr Mackay said he doubted much would change: many of the native title holders lived and/or worked on the property.   
&quot;The reality is we have provided access all along,&quot; he said.   
&quot;What it does is confirm to the Waluwarra people that native title not only exists, but we have a proper agreement in place to bring it into effect.&quot;   
Mr Mackay said the MoU should provide a good template for the future, and AACo has agreed to foster more agreements.   
While a number of MoUs have been negotiated, the Headingly agreement is the first with a major corporation.   
It is a long way from December 1996, when then-president of the National Farmers Federation, Donald McGauchie, declared the Wik decision (see box) effectively ended reconciliation. The NFF campaigned strongly against Wik.   
National Party Senator Ron Boswell claimed the Wik decision had caused the value of pastoral leases to fall considerably.   
But Kerry Herron, chairman of valuers Herron Todd White, said there was no evidence of any devaluation.   
&quot;Tree clearing, for instance, is a far bigger worry at the moment. It (native title) is a non-event.&quot;   
Fred Chaney, deputy president of National Native Title Tribunal, and a former Liberal Party federal minister, said there had been a 10-year revolution.   
In the 1990s, there were huge misconceptions about what native title meant, with Aboriginal people thinking they could take over the leases, and the pastoralists fearing such an event, Mr Chaney said.   
&quot;It has taken some time for all that to be understood as being nonsense,&quot; he said. &quot;The notion that Aborigines can&apos;t upset the legal rights of pastoralists, I think, is pretty widely accepted.   
&quot;The notion that they are going to have to live together is accepted. And that (it) is best dealt with by sitting down and talking about it, is also broadly accepted.&quot;   
John Clapin is the chairman of the native title committee of the Pastoralists and Graziers association of Western Australia.   
He said the first days of native title, when huge ambit claims arrived without warning, were a time of high anxiety. But, as determinations had been handed down, those anxieties had eased.   
&quot;Court case after court case has re-affirmed that the pastoralist lease rights prevail over native title right,&quot; Mr Clapin said. &quot;And the pastoralists are allowed to go about their business, but they are also required to have a coexistence understanding with the claimants who have been successful.&quot;   
He said an agreed set of principles had been developed in the West Australian goldfields &quot;all based on good neighbourly things about advising where and when you want to enter a pastoral lease&quot;.   
But, in six years, just six cases had been determined in the state, and there were many outstanding claims.   
&quot;They either won&apos;t proceed or there will be resolution by mediation, which is our hope once the pattern is established,&quot; Mr Clapin said.   
The chief executive of Carpentaria Land Council, Brad Foster, said the Headingly MoU was great news.   
&quot;There has been a major change with pastoralists,&quot; he said. &quot;It is definitely a big turnaround.&quot;   
He said taking a native title claim through litigation could take up to nine years, and cost millions of dollars.   
&quot;We would encourage a lot of our clients to look at negotiated outcomes. Indigenous Land Use Agreements are the way forward for us.&quot;   
Mr Foster said traditional owners wanted &quot;access to country, getting acknowledgement that they actually come from that country -- a bit of recognition&quot;.   
Ruth Wade, a member of the NNTT, admitted it had been a slow process, but a number of significant decisions had now provided a body of law.   
&quot;Every time there is a major determination, especially by litigation, people learn a little more and become a little more confident about what the legal underpinnings are,&quot; she said.   
Last week the Federal Court handed down a consent determination recognising the Wik and Wik Way peoples&apos; rights over 12,530sqkm of Cape York peninsula in north Queensland.   
Ms Wade acknowledged that determining native title was a complex process.   
&quot;But we must remember this process is saying: the way you did business for 200 years was not right, there is a system of law and custom which must be recognised, and so you need to find a way for those two systems of law to be recognised.   
&quot;That has been a major challenge for everybody.&quot;   
High Court chose to recognise fundamental indigenous custom   
* In 1992 the High Court of Australia, in the Mabo decision, overturned the notion of terra nullius (that the land belonged to no one), and recognised native title.   
That title arises out of indigenous custom and law.   
* In 1996, the High Court declared native title could co-exist with pastoral leases. In the event of a conflict, the rights of the pastoralists prevail.   
* Native title can be determined by the Federal Court, or the Court can direct the National Native Title Tribunal to mediate over it.   
Determinations of native title can be unopposed, reached through consent, or through litigation.   
* An Indigenous Land Use Agreement is a flexible, voluntary, but binding, agreement about the use and management of land made between the native title holders and other interests.   
* A memorandum of understanding is an agreement on use and access of land.   
* There are about 2500 pastoral leaseholders and pastoral leases cover 42 per cent of the country.   
* There are 35 registered determinations that native title does exist, and 138 registered ILUAs.   
* There are 599 active native title claimant applications.

THE rising oil price is biting cattle producers&apos; bottom lines.   
Australian Agricultural Co said its annual freight bill had risen by $1million. It spends $8 million a year carrying cattle to market, according to chief executive Don Mackay.   
&quot;We also generate our own electricity with diesel -- everything we do requires fuel,&quot; he said.   
Colonial Agricultural Co managing director Fred Grimwade said: &quot;I haven&apos;t worked out the (fuel) cost but obviously there would be an impact on us,&quot; he said. &quot;Transport is a big cost in the industry and something that we have to manage closely.&quot;   
Oil prices hit a record $US53 a barrel this week amid supply fears.   
Mr Mackay said the extra cost would be passed on to consumers.   
&quot;We&apos;re at the end of the chain where we don&apos;t always have the opportunity to prescribe it being passed on but it is clearly costing more money,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re minimising costs wherever possible but if you have products like animals regularly sold then you have to get them to a market and that requires fuel.&quot;   
In August, AACo reported a $22.22million full-year net profit.   
This week, the company said it had signed a landmark agreement with the Waluwarra/Georgina River people settling access and traditional activities on its northwestern Queensland property, Headingly.   
The agreement will protect significant indigenous sites on the pastoral land, and allow the traditional owners access to country to pass on culture to younger generations, AACo said.   
The company owns or leases 21 properties in Queensland and the Northern Territory, covering some 70,000sqkm of land, with all but two of the Queensland properties having native title claims over them.   
The Waluwarra/Georgina River people have native title claim over 21,353sqkm of land southwest of Mt Isa, which extends to the NT border and takes in AACo&apos;s 10,032sqkm Headingly property.   
Waluwarra Aboriginal Corporation chairwoman Marlene Speechley said the agreement was a great step towards reconciliation.   
The groups began national Native Title Tribunal mediation to develop the memorandum of understanding in October last year.

THE easing of the drought in outback Australia and growing demand for Australian beef overseas propelled cattle producer Australian Agricultural Company to a 22 per cent increase in annual net profit to $22.2 million.   
In its most recent forecast AACo had said its profit would be between 15 per cent and 25 per cent higher than last year, but more likely at the lower end of that range.   
AACo&apos;s profit for 2002-03 was 13 per cent down on the previous year, as the drought took hold and the capacity of AACo&apos;s holdings -- mostly in western Queensland and the Northern Territory -- was stretched.   
These conditions continued in the six months to December last year, but the drought has eased this year and the 468,000 beasts the company has under management have fattened accordingly.   
&quot;We believe that we are moving out of what has been a seriously dry cycle and more normal conditions appear to be returning in most areas of Australia,&quot; chief executive Don Mackay said.   
He said conditions in the first month of this year had been excellent, with growing demand worldwide for cattle and good prices because of mad cow disease. Cattle prices were about 14 per cent higher now than last year, but it was difficult to predict how they would fare over the next year, he said.   
Mr Mackay said the company was optimistic about the coming year, but offered only limited guidance, saying the company expected the result for the current 12-months to be similar to that released yesterday.   
During the past year AACo tried to take over the massive Stanbroke holdings from AMP, an exercise that cost the company $2.7 million.   
But that takeover was thwarted by a group of Queensland cattlemen, who have since been brought out by the syndicate&apos;s head, Peter Mennegazzo.   
AACo shares rose 2c yesterday to $1.32.

THE Australian Agricultural Co may have found another home for its cattle -- inside Shakespeares pies.   
AACo announced yesterday it had sold the Jesters Pies business it bought in December 2002 to Shakespeares Pies, which is controlled by former Australian Rugby League chief Neil Whittaker&apos;s Sydney-based investment company Hunter Bay Partners.   
AACo gets a 25 per cent stake in the enlarged Shakespeares and a place on the board.   
The deal marks a new phase in the &quot;paddock-to-plate&quot; strategy espoused by former chief executive Peter Holmes a Court, under which AACo would be involved in the breeding, growing, butchering, cooking and selling of beef.   
Since he left in January, AACo has concentrated on efficiencies further up the supply chain.   
By handing the day-to-day running of Jesters over to Shakespeares, new chief executive Don Mackay can focus on breeding and production. And taking an equity stake in the merged entity offers a better chance of retaining and expanding a source of demand.   
&quot;It is not a precondition of the deal, but we have the capacity and we would hope to supply to the joint business,&quot; he said.   
He said AACo was negotiating retail supply contracts for its 1824 premium beef brand but direct retail was not a priority.   
&quot;We&apos;re able to present product to retailers and we&apos;re looking to develop the value in the 1824 brand, but ownership of retail isn&apos;t the best route to market for us,&quot; he said.   
However, AACo would be a long-term investor in the Shakespeares/Jesters business, he said.   
The sale price was not disclosed.   
Mr Mackay said there were no plans to exit any of AACo&apos;s other downstream businesses, which include meat processor Chef&apos;s Partners and farm management firm Rural Management Partners.

* Trusts  
A MANAGED scheme being launched today aims to make cattle industry returns accessible to smaller investors.  
Australian Agricultural Co subsidiary Rural Management Partners and Melbourne-based agricultural investment company Environinvest hope to raise $5.5 million for the rural trust, Environinvest Beef Cattle Project 2004.  
Under the plan, investors will buy &quot;droves&quot; of cattle, each comprising four females for $1750, which includes management, agistment and cattle lease fees, plus GST.  
Investors will pay fees of $420 plus GST per head in years one to three, dropping to $320 and $230 by year six.  
The minimum initial investment will be 10 droves, or $17,500.  
The cattle will be run on 130,000ha of leasehold properties in Queensland and NSW. All progeny and offspring will become assets of the investor.  
Revenue will come from the sale of steers, cull cows and cull heifers during the seven-year life of the project and at the end when the herd is sold.  
&quot;We are offering the chance for investors to tap into Australia&apos;s globally competitive beef cattle industry, without having to overcome the traditional hurdle of a large capital requirement,&quot; Environinvest chairman Roger Pescott said.  
He said the scheme was structured to provide higher returns and achieve economies of scale by not carrying the cost of land holdings on its balance sheet. Annual after-tax returns of 14 per cent were forecast after the second year.  
The project had the obligatory product rulings from the Australian Taxation Office.  
The project planned to start with a herd of 12,500 and grow to an estimated 50,000.  
RMP managing director Chris Evans said most profits would come from the sale of the herd.  
He said the strength of the Australian beef industry would be a key factor.  
Mr Evans said 60 per cent of the cattle would be agisted on NSW properties and 40 per cent in northern and central Queensland.  
Cooplacurripa, in NSW&apos;s Upper Manning River Valley, will carry about 10,000 of the project&apos;s initial herd.  
The 22,500ha station is the largest cattle property in south-eastern Australia and was leased by RMP last year after a $16 million sale to Sydney&apos;s Bydand Holdings.  
Also under agistment to the scheme is Mogila Station near Walgett in NSW, which covers 62,500ha and will carry 2000 cattle.  
In Queensland, the 70,500ha Crystal Brook Station west of Cairns will carry 6000 head, while the 9000ha Tallawalah Station near St Lawrence will have 3000 cattle.  
Mr Evans said the properties had been selected for a wide geographic spread to reduce climatic and seasonal risk and for greater economies of scale.

			<TEXT>* Auctions   
AUSTRALIAN Agricultural Co yesterday raised $15.3 million at auction from the sale of four cattle stations near Longreach in central Queensland.   
Hughenden district grazier Malcolm McClymont bought the most valuable property: the 66,668ha Maneroo, for $9 million. The others went to local grazing families.   
The 25,000ha Corona, which AACo had held for 127 years, sold for $4.5 million to Peter and Lisa Magoffin of Melrose at Longreach.   
The 4800ha Dexters sold for $1 million to the Milton family of Strathdarr at Longreach, and the Miltons also bought the 2567ha Invercauld, for $800,000.   
Mr McClymont last year was ranked as Australia&apos;s 14th biggest cattle producer in an Outback magazine survey of Australia&apos;s biggest cattle companies.   
He is understood to have about 40,000 cattle and five properties, including Bethel, Molesworth and Yambore at Maxwellton, Mount Surprise and Mount Sturgeon at Hughenden.   
More than 180 people attended yesterday&apos;s auction, said auctioneer Dick Allpass, of agency Elders, and 50 people had inspected the properties.   
Elders sales manager Garry Baker said the sales proved that &quot;the market is still very strong&quot; for good properties that were well presented.   
The prices achieved were &quot;good, honest&quot; values and equated to some of the best prices achieved last year.   
They were &quot;name&quot; properties, he said. Apart from Corona&apos;s long history under AACo ownership, the company had held the other three since the early 1980s.   
&quot;What it tells you is that northern cattlemen and the local families know value very well ... so it was a good representation of local knowledge buying at very good prices,&quot; Mr Baker said. All the properties were sold bare of livestock.   
After three bad years, this year they had 220mm of rain in February and a further 56mm two weeks ago, &quot;so we&apos;re heading for a good winter and a pretty good spring&quot;, he said.   
AACo recently has been more prominent as a buyer than a seller, with its $50 million purchase in January of Carrum Station near Julia Creek.

			<TEXT>The break-up of Stanbroke after the Menegazzo manoeuvre points to further ownership change in the Australian cattle industry, Andrew Fraser reports  
THE looming break-up of the Stanbroke pastoral empire is set to begin a fundamental realignment of Australia&apos;s beef industry as properties in the north change hands.  
For Stanbroke&apos;s main competition, the Brisbane-based Australian Agricultural Co, the implications are that AACo&apos;s paddock-to-plate strategy will be put on hold as it concentrates on gaining efficiencies early in the supply chain.  
Last week, former Victorian potato farmer Peter Menegazzo bought out his partners and took full ownership of Stanbroke in a deal that valued the pastoral empire at $700 million. He immediately placed five properties worth $150 million on the market.  
Menegazzo does not deny that he intends breaking up Stanbroke, and for AACo chief executive Don Mackay, this game plan means opportunities for his company -- after Stanbroke, the biggest producer of cattle in Australia -- to gain efficiencies through larger holdings.  
&quot;Something like two-thirds of our properties share a border with Stanbroke properties,&quot; Mackay says.  
&quot;The bigger we become, the more opportunities we have to get those efficiencies early on the supply chain.  
&quot;And the bigger we get in a financial sense, the higher up we get on the radar screens of the institutions and that will be more important to us in the future.&quot;  
The opportunity to expand its holdings through picking up individual Stanbroke properties, and expanding on the 460,000 head of cattle it has now, also comes at a time of changes within AACo, Australia&apos;s oldest company, established in 1824 by an Act of the British Parliament.  
The paddock-to-plate strategy of vertical integration in meat production so aggressively pursued by previous chief executive Peter Holmes a Court has been cut back to a paddock-to-abattoir strategy.  
It means the existing retail businesses, such as the 1824 beef brand and the Jesters Pie business, will be retained, but there will be a greater emphasis on breeding and production, where Mackay sees the greatest potential for value-adding and profit for the company.  
&quot;At the moment, there&apos;s more potential for us in being a supplier of that product to somebody else,&quot; he says.  
&quot;If it&apos;s marketed under someone else&apos;s brand, so be it.  
&quot;Would we like it to be under our brand? Yes. Is that likely in large volumes in the very short term? No.&quot;  
Mackay is a very different chief executive from Holmes a Court, whose family background and own background as a theatre promoter always made him seem more comfortable in Sydney, where the company was based when it listed in August 2001, rather than north-west Queensland and the Northern Territory, where AACo has its holdings.  
By contrast, Mackay comes from a property near Dubbo and joined Elders in 1974, rising up through the ranks to become NSW manager in the 90s and then joining AACo in 1999.  
Continued -- Page 27  
From Page 25  
He is an old rugby player who wears elastic-sided boots and even in the city his dress sense looks like something out of an R.M. Williams catalogue.  
Typical of Mackay&apos;s priorities is the way he is changing the genetic make-up of the AACo herd to maximise its output.  
This involves cross-breeding the traditional European-derived Bos taurus cattle -- the basis of most cattle in southern Australia -- with the Senepol brand of cattle, which comes from the Caribbean island of St Croix.  
&quot;The quality of meat on the Senepol is first class, but they&apos;re not a big animal and there&apos;s not enough of them,&quot; Mackay says.  
&quot;By crossing the types, you get a breed that&apos;s bigger and faster and stronger and can thrive in the tropics.&quot;  
Another move under Mackay&apos;s stewardship is the purchase of six properties near Surat in western Queensland, which will be used as backgrounding properties as they are close to the company&apos;s Aronui feedlot.  
Again, it is maximising the value of production before the animal is slaughtered.  
Further down the production chain, Mackay is not ruling out more moves, but he is not in any hurry to revive the paddock-to-plate strategy.  
He points out that while Stanbroke may have its own abattoir at Grantham, near Toowoomba, there is plenty of capacity already in Queensland&apos;s meat-processing sector and there is little value for the company to dive into the area.  
Likewise in retail.  
&quot;For us, it&apos;s not a core competency,&quot; he says. &quot;If you&apos;re going to be in retail in a substantial way, you&apos;ve got to have an understanding of it and a commitment to it.&quot;  
AACo has just about completed moving its corporate headquarters from Sydney to Brisbane, a step which came when Mackay replaced Holmes a Court.  
He was not the only one who decided to stay in Sydney -- the company&apos;s chief financial officer, Luisa Catanzaro, also decided to stay put and leaves the company in June, to be replaced by Stephen Toms, currently the chief financial officer at Queensland Cotton Holdings Ltd.  
But the more immediate influence on AACo is, as in most rural areas, the weather. The continuing drought hit the company hard last year when profit dropped 11 per cent from the previous year. But in a reflection of better conditions, the company last week forecast a 15 per cent increase in profit to $21 million for the current financial year.  
AACo would be one of the very few companies that is hoping for storm clouds on the horizon.

			<TEXT>* Grazing   
THE Australian Agricultural Company has reported a significant increase in beef sales for the first nine months of its financial year and flagged interest in any parts of the Stanbroke cattle empire which could be unloaded by its new owner.   
Chief executive Don Mackay said yesterday that AACo, the underbidder when AMP sold the Stanbroke business last year, was keen to talk to Stanbroke&apos;s new outright owner, Peter Menegazzo, about the sale of any surplus properties.   
&quot;We have a relationship with the company and I have a relationship with the chairman, now the owner,&quot; he said.   
&quot;If they had property which suited us, then we&apos;d be very interested in talking.&quot;   
But since the abortive takeover attempt, AACo has changed shape, picking up two cattle properties in central Queensland for $50 million which gave it an extra 58,000 head of cattle, and last month purchasing six properties near Surat in western Queensland close to its Aronui feedlot.   
&quot;We&apos;d definitely have made the second purchase anyway because we use them as backgrounding properties for the feedlot, but if we&apos;d acquired Stanbroke, I doubt if we&apos;d have purchased Lawn Hill and Carrum in central Queensland,&quot; he said.   
The changed shape of AACo was apparent yesterday when the company released its third-quarter results, which showed a large increase in sales for the nine months to the end of March compared with the previous corresponding period.   
The report showed beef sales of 28.4 million kilograms in the nine-month period compared with 24.3 million in the comparable reporting period.   
The increase in sales volume coupled with the increase in world prices for cattle prompted the company to forecast a 15 per cent increase in net profit this year to $21 million.   
&quot;Seasonal conditions have improved a lot -- we&apos;ve struggled for the past two to three years, but now it&apos;s a more normal season,&quot; Mr Mackay said.   
He said one reason for the increase in world prices was a shortage of beef into Asian markets -- notably Japan and South Korea -- because of the threat of disease in US cattle.   
&quot;That&apos;s a sensitive situation and we are talking to the authorities there about a long-term resolution,&quot; he said.   
&quot;But we expect the increase in prices to last until the end of the year and that&apos;s the basis for our prediction.&quot;   
AACo shares rose 2c yesterday to $1.20.

			<TEXT>RURAL   
The new chief of Australian Agricultural Co,   
Don Mackay, talks to Fiona Cameron about the company&apos;s plans to buy more properties   
DON Mackay reckons he has the best job in Australia. The new chief executive officer of Australian Agricultural Co brims with pride when he talks about the 180-year-old company that was established by royal decree &quot;to develop the wastelands of New South Wales&quot;.   
&quot;We also ran the first railways in this country,&quot; Mackay says. &quot;Things like that just make it a fascinating organisation to be involved with.&quot;   
He is not the only one who thinks so. Late last year UNESCO granted AACo&apos;s archives a special status as part of the &quot;memory of the world&quot;, along with Captain Cook&apos;s logs and several other Australian items.   
The company&apos;s records fill a section of the National Archives in Canberra, and occupy a full-time curator.   
And AACo is still making the news. Its modern history is a work in progress. As the nation&apos;s second-biggest cattle producer, it last year took a tilt at the biggest, Stanbroke Pastoral Co.   
AACo&apos;s bid to buy Stanbroke failed, even though it claims to have offered a higher price than the $490 million that secured the purchase for Nebo Holdings.   
The company&apos;s legal action for damages against vendor AMP Life over the deal continues, including $2.5 million for costs associated with the tender, and up to $100 million for loss of future earnings.   
&quot;We are disappointed with the process obviously,&quot; Mackay says.   
&quot;Our issues are limited entirely to the original owner, AMP. We have no difficulty at all with the current owners. We have an issue with AMP and we are continuing to pursue it.&quot;   
AACo is still seen as a possible buyer of the Stanbroke assets, with Nebo consortium member and Hungry Jack founder Jack Cowin reviewing the future of his 25 per cent interest in the Stanbroke properties.   
Mackay took over when former chief executive Peter Holmes a Court resigned in January after AACo&apos;s failure on the Stanbroke deal.   
&quot;I am by definition different to Peter. Peter had a particular style, I have always had, and continue to have, a more operational focus.&quot;   
Mackay was previously AACo managing director after transferring from parent company Elders Ltd three years ago.   
&quot;I guess it&apos;s for others to judge what sort of style I have,&quot; he says.   
But Holmes a Court brought much-needed skills at the right time, he says.   
&quot;I think the mix was good, and particularly for the float and the subsequent period, Peter brought some enormous benefits and opportunities to the organisation.&quot;   
Holmes a Court invested about $15 million in AACo shares in 2001, and continues to hold that position and a seat on the board.   
AACo reported a $2.9 million loss for the six months to December 2003, which included $900,000 in costs relating to its exit from the Polkinghornes butcher store business, and $2.5 million in costs on the Stanbroke tender.   
Gone are some of the flashy ambitions of times gone by, and it seems now to be very much a &quot;getting on with business&quot; attitude.   
Just three years ago Holmes a Court said the company aimed to run a million head of cattle -- now Mackay says size matters only as a function of other things.   
&quot;Our focus is on making this an organisation that provides very strong returns for shareholders, within all the constraints of running a company appropriately, with various social and environmental responsibilities,&quot; he says. &quot;The only reason for being large is if it delivers under those headings.&quot;   
But there are compelling reasons for being big.   
Mackay notes that size provides marketing and purchasing power but points out that even if AACo had won Stanbroke it still would have accounted for only about 3 1/2 per cent of Australia&apos;s cattle trade.   
&quot;[In cattle] it would be difficult to have a balance sheet that was big enough to be what is considered large in other industries,&quot; Mackay says. &quot;Double digit percentage is just not likely, it&apos;s just not going to happen.&quot;   
But expansion remains on the agenda. AACo is on the lookout for properties to buy, and in January spent $50 million on north Queensland station Carrum Downs, 58,000 head of cattle and the grazing rights to the property Lawn Hill.   
At its listing in August 2001, the company had 340,000 head of cattle, and it has 460,000 now.   
It is also expanding through its subsidiary Rural Management Partners, which is putting together property trusts specialising in cattle stations, and planning to spend up to $200 million.   
Despite some challenges, AACo is continuing its vertical integration strategy, Mackay says.   
&quot;We need to have a very focused approach to the development of any downstream activity we are involved in,&quot; he says. &quot;It needs to add underlying value to the core production business.&quot;   
The continued development of AACo&apos;s 1824 beef brand will do that domestically and internationally, Mackay says. The company is also selling some of its beef through a wagyu beef marketing business it controls, Kobe Cuisine.   
Building direct relationships with customers and retailers has proved difficult, says Mackay, but there remains no doubt that &quot;it&apos;s a path that we need to tread&quot;.   
&quot;If you don&apos;t develop those relationships and have some influence over the sharing of that value, you&apos;re just at the markets mercy,&quot; he says. &quot;We&apos;re a large player in terms of production but we&apos;re not a large player in terms of processing and delivery, so we&apos;ve got to be careful how we tread.&quot;   
Although AACo is purely a beef company, there&apos;s no reason it would not diversify in the future.   
&quot;If you can apply the core skills of our organisation into other areas, then obviously in time you would consider it.&quot;   
Mackay says the fact that the business has been able to continually adapt &quot;is why it&apos;s still here&quot;.   
&quot;It started with sheep, ended up in mining, and then progressed into sheep, cattle, grazing and farming, and is now of course focused principally on cattle.   
&quot;So for me to sit in judgment and say that we will never go into anything else, that&apos;s highly unlikely.&quot;   
Mackay says when he was offered the job of AACo managing director three years ago, it was an opportunity he &quot;grabbed with both hands&quot;. Now he&apos;s CEO, it seems he&apos;s still thrilled to be there, even if it was not something he ever imagined doing when he was a boy.   
Mackay moved to Dubbo early in life from his family&apos;s farm, Carinyah, on the Bogan River, between Nyngan and Brewarrina.   
&quot;I guess I always thought one day I&apos;d go back and own land, but that hasn&apos;t occurred.&quot;

			<TEXT>* Pastoral    
AUSTRALIAN Agricultural Co missed out on buying Stanbroke Pastoral last year but the two cattle companies are now running neck-and-neck in terms of herd size.    
AACo&apos;s numbers were boosted to 460,000 head last month following its $50 million deal on two north Queensland stations, and Stanbroke&apos;s herd is understood to be below 470,000 after its sale of three stations and about 37,000 head last November.    
AACo this week posted a $2.9 million half-year net loss, but said it expects full-year earnings to be between 15 per cent and 25 per cent higher than last year&apos;s $18.3 million net profit.    
AACo&apos;s latest acquisitions were Carrum Station near Julia Creek and the agistment rights on Lawn Hill station in Queensland&apos;s north-west.    
AACo chief executive Don Mackay said AACo remained interested in the Stanbroke holdings.    
&quot;We&apos;re in the market for property and they clearly have some wonderful assets, and if they were to be offered for sale we would have an interest,&quot; he said.    
Stanbroke was sold last September by long-time owner AMP Life to investment consortium Nebo Holdings, in a deal worth $490 million.    
The new owners then quickly sold off three properties for a total of about $50 million.    
Two north Queensland stations, Lyndhurst and Carpentaria Downs, went to Acton Land &amp; Cattle Co, and the southern Queensland property Rockybank was sold separately.    
Stanbroke was also seeking a buyer for its central Queensland property Havilah, with an asking price around $26 million.    
Nebo Holdings part-owner Jack Cowin, founder of Hungry Jacks hamburger chain, said last month that numerous would-be buyers came forward after news that the Stanbroke empire could be split further.    
For the past two years, AACo has been larger than Stanbroke in terms of kilograms of beef sold.    
AACo ran the nation&apos;s biggest cattle herd before 1997, when Stanbroke grew in size by one third after paying $65 million for five properties from the Bankers Trust rural portfolio.    
Current Stanbroke herd numbers are not available. But its herd of more than 500,000 head was understood to have shrunk to about 490,000 in the drought.    
&quot;To be frank, (herd size) is not something I&apos;ve assessed,&quot; AACo chief executive Don Mackay said.    
&quot;I would think they (Stanbroke) would still be the largest player in the marketplace. It&apos;s not a mantle I&apos;m claiming.&quot;

THE Australian Agricultural Company posted a first-half loss yesterday, saying the drought and its unsuccessful bid for AMP&apos;s Stanbroke pastoral properties had eroded profits.   
But the beef producer predicted it would soon bounce back, with recent rainfall, record beef prices and the emergence of mad cow disease in the US all steering it towards its full-year net profit forecast of 15-25 per cent above last years&apos; profit of $18.3 million.   
In the six months to December 31, AACo booked a loss of $2.9 million due to the carry-over costs of last year&apos;s crippling drought and the costs incurred in its doomed bid for the former AMP-owned cattle empire.   
The loss compares to a profit of $3.8 million for the first half of the 2003 financial year, but was described as &quot;small&quot; by AACo&apos;s new chief executive Don Mackay.   
A total $2.5 million was written off by AACo for the one-off expense of bidding for Stanbroke.   
The company booked a further loss of $900,000 relating to the exit of the Polkinghorne&apos;s butcher business.   
In a statement, Mr Mackay said: &quot;While we are reporting a small net loss for the first half, it is important to remember the first half result has been impacted by the carry over of costs incurred as a result of last year&apos;s drought.&quot;   
On the weather front, the company reported Queensland and NSW had received &quot;very good wet season rains in January and February&quot; which will lead to &quot;dramatically improved pasture conditions in calender 2004&quot;.   
The improved conditions will boost cattle sale weights and reduce costs at AACo&apos;s feedlots.   
The company also reported it is benefiting from last year&apos;s discovery of BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) or mad cow disease in the US. Australian exports to Asia have increased as US exports have fallen.   
AACo declared that its prices for grain-fed cattle destined for Japan and South Korea in January increased by 10-12 per cent.   
The company said its herd of 395,000 cattle was valued at $240 million at December 31, giving it an average price per head of $608. This compares to $550 per head on June 30, 2003 and $496 on December 31, 2002.   
AACo&apos;s shares closed 4c lower at $1.28.

			<TEXT>* Agribusiness   
IT was steady as she goes for the share price of Australian Agricultural Co yesterday, a pleasant change to the bronco bucking following news of the retirement of chief executive Peter Holmes a Court.   
News of Mr Holmes a Court&apos;s departure sent the shares down to $1.22 -- wiping out many of the gains of late December when the shares skyrocketed from a low of $1.07 to $1.30 -- as punters bet on a boon from the discovery of mad cow disease in the US.   
Mr Holmes a Court&apos;s move has fuelled the inevitable speculation. Surely he couldn&apos;t give up such a plum job just because he didn&apos;t want to move the family to Brisbane?   
As analysts guessed that the departure spelled a schism on the board, Mr Holmes a Court repeated that the decision was motivated by plain old family reasons. In the often cynical world of business -- and the even more cynical world of the media -- such a simple reason seemed laughable.   
&quot;There&apos;s absolutely nothing else behind the decision. It was part of a strategic plan that resulted in the relocation of the head office. In my case it was clearly because of my family situation and because I enjoy living in Sydney,&quot; he said.   
He also dismissed as &quot;Freudian pop psychology&quot; the suggestion that his reluctance to move had something to do with his upbringing -- he is the son of one of Australia&apos;s most famous corporate raiders, the late Robert Holmes a Court -- which he described as &quot;stable&quot;.   
Nevertheless, it is apparent that Mr Holmes a Court did lose the fight at board level to maintain AACo&apos;s headquarters in Sydney. But even on that score he is stoical.   
&quot;One of the things I&apos;m most proud of is that I took AACo from being a subsidiary to being an independent listed company with an independent board. You can&apos;t on the one hand say that you&apos;re proud of that and then resist a decision of the board.&quot;   
Analysts describe Mr Holmes a Court&apos;s tenure as steady but note that his three and a half years only produced &quot;some incremental change and no step change&quot;.   
Even the recent $50 million purchase of pastoral property Carrum Downs in Queensland or last year&apos;s purchase of the West Australian-based Jesters Pie chain is not considered &quot;company changing&quot;.   
&quot;It&apos;s still a beef producer,&quot; said one analyst. &quot;Now it&apos;s just a bigger beef producer.&quot;   
And now there&apos;s the inevitable speculation about his future. Will he go back to his roots and launch another theatre company like the one he ran in New York?   
&quot;The only thing that I can say, without being impolite, is that it won&apos;t be something in drama. Look I&apos;ve enjoyed the listed environment in Australia very much,&quot; he said.   
&quot;It may be in agriculture. I continue to believe there are opportunities in agriculture for consolidation and growth but I&apos;ll be looking at all sectors after I&apos;ve had a couple of weeks off.&quot;   
He described the recent refinancing of his $15 million loan from AACo&apos;s major shareholder, Futuris, as mere &quot;paperwork, begun 13 months ago&quot; and unrelated to his decision to move on.

			<TEXT>* Management   
PETER Holmes a Court has stepped down as chief executive of Australian Agricultural Company after the board signed off on a series of organisational changes which included moving the head office to Brisbane.   
The company said the board had resolved to consolidate all senior operational and functional management in Brisbane, which would mean closing the Sydney head office and changes within the management team.   
Mr Holmes a Court declined to relocate, the AACo statement said.   
&quot;I have got a young family ... I just moved my wife who is a New Yorker to Sydney,&quot; Mr Holmes a Court told The Australian yesterday.   
&quot;It was a very strong and good time to make a change.&quot;   
Mr Holmes a Court, who has been chief since 2000, will remain a non-executive director and an investor in the company which has become one of the largest cattle companies in Australia.   
&quot;I am very proud to be leaving AACo in a very strong position,&quot; he said.   
&quot;Since joining in 2000, we have weathered an extensive drought while returning shareholders an above market return and grown to be the largest breeding herd in Australia.   
&quot;Current market conditions provide great opportunities for AACo.&quot;   
Mr Holmes a Court will be replaced by the company&apos;s executive director of operations, Don MacKay.

CATTLE baron Peter Holmes a Court is preparing to capitalise on the misfortunes of the Stanbroke pastoral company if Australia&apos;s biggest cattle business is broken up following a schism among its new owners.   
A source close to Mr Holmes a Court&apos;s Australian Agricultural Co said the business was watching events unfold at Stanbroke and would probably make a play for any Stanbroke properties if they became available.   
AACo was the losing bidder when Stanbroke&apos;s 27 properties across the Northern Territory and Queensland were sold by AMP in September for $490 million. However, the new owner, the Nebo consortium, has already fractured, with fast food giant Jack Cowin set to sell down his 25 per cent stake.   
The source said that AACo was still interested in Stanbroke, despite losing in last year&apos;s controversial bidding war.   
The spokesman said: &quot;If Stanbroke is broken up into 1000 pieces, then absolutely AACo would be interested.&quot;   
AACo is in an expansionary mood after announcing the purchase of Queensland properties worth $50 million this week.   
It has not given up on the Stanbroke properties, despite losing its legal challenge against Nebo&apos;s purchase late last year.   
Rural sources said Mr Cowin had found it impossible to continue at Nebo because of disagreements between Stanbroke&apos;s 50 per cent owner, Peter Menegazzo, and the four Queensland families, led by Peter Hughes, who together own the remaining 25 per cent.   
Mr Menegazzo, a Victorian potato farmer, did not return calls yesterday but the sources said Nebo&apos;s problems were well known in cattle circles, and the diverse interests of the Nebo members meant they never saw eye to eye on the company&apos;s future.   
Despite asurances that Nebo would not break up the Stanbroke empire, it has already sold three properties to help pay the debt accrued in the purchase.   
AACo now hopes that more properties will come on the market quickly in what amounts to a fire sale so that the premium price achieved in the first three property sales is not repeated.

			<TEXT>* Property   
AUSTRALIA&apos;S biggest beef producer has forked out $50 million for a Queensland grazing property -- and immediately denied the deal was motivated by a bid to exploit the bans on US beef imposed after the mad cow scare.   
Australian Agricultural Company chief executive Peter Holmes a Court said yesterday negotiations to buy the 50,613-hectare Carrum Station in Queensland from a South American magnate had been under way before the mad cow scare saw Asian buyers slap bans on US beef.   
AACo exports 25 per cent of its production to Japan, but is looking to increase its sales after the ban on US beef imports to Japan.   
Carrum was the last of a string of properties bought by the Brazilian millionaire Sebastian Maia in the late 1970s. Mr Maia&apos;s nephew Aramis Patti Maia, who owns an airline in Brazil, took over the reins of the property about three years ago.   
The property, located near the small town of Julia Creek, 250km east of Mount Isa, will be used to fatten young female calves until they reach feedlot entry weight, Mr Holmes a Court said.   
The young heifers, which were on seven properties, could now be consolidated at Carrum Station, he said.   
This would take pressure off AACo&apos;s other properties, which are spread across seven million hectares in Queensland and the Northern Territory.   
The company, a losing bidder for AMP&apos;s Stanbroke property empire last year, was looking for more properties to add to its 21-property porfolio carrying 460,000 head of cattle.   
Each property is specialised in either breeding, growing, or &quot;finishing&quot; the cattle to market specifications, Mr Holmes a Court said. They are then sold either for export, or to the local top-end restaurant market.   
Carrum Station -- which include two feedlots and grain and hay-growing properties -- was a &quot;good fit&quot; with the company&apos;s other assets because it is adjacent to rail and road links at Julia Creek.   
The purchase includes 58,000 cattle and a long-term lease over the Aboriginal conglomerate-owned Lawn Hill Station, which is nine times the size of Carrum station and has a carrying capacity of 40,000 cattle.   
Lawn Hill would be used as a breeding station for 25,000 cows -- bringing AACo&apos;s total numbers to 190,000 heifers.   
AACo will take operational control of the property and cattle this week, Mr Holmes a Court said. He said the property was in a &quot;low activity&quot; season due to the wet season which began in December.   
AACo had a weak performance in its first quarter, but market conditions had improved, he said. &quot;Meat prices are still high in America and demand is still strong in America,&quot; he said.   
The negative effects of the strong Australian dollar had been offset by strong demand due to the interruption to the US export capacity, he said.   
Shares in the company, which have soared since the mad cow scare in the US, rose 4c to $1.26.

THE Australian Agricultural Company is forecasting a strong second-half result as it reaps the benefit of better seasonal conditions and a spread of properties.   
AACo yesterday returned a profit of $6.7 million for the six months to the end of June, but chief executive Don Mackay said he was &quot;comfortable&quot; with market forecasts of a profit of $27 million to $28 million for the full year ending December 31.   
While the AACo is one of the oldest companies in Australia, it has been a listed company for only four years, and in that time has worked on the traditional financial year ending June 30.   
But the company is changing its reporting schedule in favour of full-year results to the year ending December 31, to better reflect the seasonal impact on what is Australia&apos;s largest beef exporter.   
By contrast, the company&apos;s profit for the 12 months ended June 30, 2004 -- the most recent full year -- was recorded at $22.2 million.   
In the most recent six-month period, drought was a major factor, but Mr Mackay said strong rains in late June changed the dynamics of the cattle market completely and he was confident of a strong performance for the current six-month period.   
&quot;Before that, there was a market that was flooded with a lot of cattle which weren&apos;t properly fattened, even though there were strong levels of demand,&quot; he said.   
&quot;But we now have good cattle coming through and prices are holding up very well.&quot;   
Due to the changes in reporting periods, AACo could compare only the six months to the end of June with the six months to the end of December -- which, while valid under ASX reporting rules, is hardly valid for an industry so subject to seasonal variations.   
Mr Mackay said the company&apos;s spread of properties provided some insurance against the worst excesses of drought, but AACo had still chosen to defer some cattle sales and these were expected to come through in the current reporting period.   
The company&apos;s revenue for the most recent six months was $85.6 million, an increase on previous periods, largely because of increased property and cattle holdings through the purchase of Victoria River Group.   
But Mr Mackay said the one possible threat to the industry could occur once the US was allowed to export beef back into the AACo&apos;s big overseas markets of Japan and South Korea, which was expected around the end of the year.   
&quot;But because of the conditions that will be put on them to allow them to sell product into those countries, and because they also have strong levels of demand in their own country, we don&apos;t anticipate the effect will be as great as it would have been if the bans had been lifted earlier,&quot; he said.   
When there was concern about the drought earlier in the year, AACo mollified the market by announcing that it would pay a dividend this year.   
Yesterday, it announced that it would pay a dividend of 7c for the full year, up from the 6c it paid in the most recent full year.   
The concern about the impact of the drought pushed the company&apos;s shares to as low as $1.33 in May, but yesterday the AACo was steady at $1.78.

IMPROVING market confidence has boosted shares in beef producer Australian Agricultural Company as the group brushes aside concerns over the drought.  
Shares in AACo continued their rebound yesterday from a low two weeks ago of $1.34, lifting 10c or 7 per cent to $1.52 on high volumes. Traders said most of the buying was through major Queensland retail brokers.  
AACo shares had peaked at $1.93 on March 2 but concerns about the effect of the drought, the imminent re-entry of US beef into the Japanese market and a capital raising placement produced large-scale selling.  
But ABN AMRO Morgans analyst Belinda Moore said the market had responded positively to AACo managing director Don Mackay&apos;s assurance last month that the company would probably pay a dividend again this year.  
Mr Mackay also said recent rain in Queensland had buoyed the cattle group, with only two of AACo&apos;s 25 properties in that state and the Northern Territory affected by the drought.  
&quot;We&apos;ve got an add recommendation on it and a target price of $1.70,&quot; Ms Moore said. &quot;We believe it will have a good year and will see strong cash flow from this company. It&apos;s significantly undervalued.&quot;  
Australia&apos;s biggest cattle company booked a $6.18 million net profit for the six months to December 31, compared to a $2.86 million loss in the previous corresponding period.  
AACo will hold its annual general meeting tomorrow.  
US beef exports were banned in Japan after the discovery of BSE -- mad cow disease -- in December 2003.

LEADING beef producer Australian Agricultural Company will seek $65 million to cover a buying spree and give it flexibility for future opportunities.  
Through a one-for-five renounceable rights issue, the company will offer 40.42 million shares at $1.65 a share.  
It said it expected to raise $65million, after taking into account expenses of the issue.  
AACo chief executive Don Mackay said the company had made a number of acquisitions over the past couple of years with two or three reasonably large purchases in the past 12 months.  
This included spending $80million for the Tejas aggregation in the Victoria River area of the Northern Territory in a deal settled late last year.  
After a trading halt was lifted yesterday, AACo shares closed 9c lower at $1.73. The offer will close on April 14 with an allotment date of of April 22.

AACo, led by chief executive Don Mackay, above, released half-year results last night.   
Net profit was $6.2 million compared to a loss of $2.9 million previously.   
It will be the last December-half set of accounts from AACo, which has won approval from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to change to a December-year balance date.   
For the year to December 31, AACo, with a record 524,000 head of cattle at the end of the year, had net profit of $31.3 million, nearly three times the $11.6 million of 2003.   
&quot;Demand for beef has been growing strongly with improving economic conditions in Asia as well as an overall increase in demand in the US,&quot; the company said. &quot;This has delivered significant improvement in prices.&quot;

Land values may have reached their peak but the outlook for 2005 remains solid, writes Fiona Cameron  
SIGNS remain good for rural property in 2005, but the boom is over and further growth in land values cannot be expected this year, according to analysts.  
A record-breaking share market also continues to compete strongly for investment funds.  
The stampeding cattle station market looks firm and although land values are steadying, big deals continue to flow.  
In the past two months, Australian Agricultural Co further confirmed its position as the nation&apos;s biggest cattle producer, announcing its $80 million purchase of 75,000 cattle and three Northern Territory stations covering 8865sqkm.  
And last month The Australian revealed that a consortium of British investors had paid about $30million for a 24 per cent stake in North Australian Pastoral Co, another of the nation&apos;s biggest landowners and cattle industry players.  
&quot;With high beef prices likely to get even stronger this year, confidence is very high and we would expect cattle property prices to be fully firm on the highs of 2004, indeed as evidenced by the sales reported in central Queensland in the normally quiet December/January,&quot; said rural valuer Kerry Herron in Herron Todd White&apos;s first market analysis of the year.  
Research firm Analysing Agriculture says beef prices should hold &quot;reasonably well&quot; in 2005, especially in the first half of the year.  
&quot;The uncertainty surrounding the future of the beef market is focused on the Australian dollar, the eventual amount of beef that might flow from the US to Japan and South Korea, and the prices now established by cheap South American and Indian beef in many of our other traditional Asian markets,&quot; Analysing Agriculture&apos;s John Chudleigh said.  
Australian beef producers continued to benefit from the US&apos;s misfortune in contracting BSE, or &quot;mad cow disease&quot;.  
In wool, the increase in Australia&apos;s sheep numbers and world wool production may keep downward pressure on prices in the long term, although a short-term recovery soon was &quot;technically possible&quot;.  
&quot;Land values are more complex than any one commodity and particularly in the mixed farming areas, it really needs a downturn in all commodities to affect land prices,&quot; Prof Chudleigh said.  
&quot;I suspect they will stay fairly strong, because of beef and sheep meats and hopefully a recovery in the grains.  
&quot;I can&apos;t see the wool story having a major impact on land values.&quot;  
He said most rural producers were aware that they needed to &quot;make hay while the sun shines&quot; and while things were good now, farmers needed to make sure they were putting away cash or &quot;something&quot; to get through downturns.  
&quot;That&apos;s how the good long-term operators survive,&quot; Prof Chudleigh said.  
Analysing Agriculture&apos;s latest report, out this week, describes the beef market as a &quot;paradox&quot;.  
&quot;Japanese beef consumption fell by 21 per cent in 2004 as consumers shunned beef, imports fell by 25 per cent, Korean consumption fell by 27 per cent and imports by 55 per cent and yet Australia has had one of its best price years on record by concentrating principally on those two markets,&quot; the report says.  
&quot;Consumption is forecast to recover slightly in each case in 2005 but to nowhere near the levels pre-BSE.&quot;  
Agency Landmark&apos;s national manager (real estate) Kerry O&apos;Connell said the boom in rural land values was over, but many signs were still good.  
&quot;We have been through a boom period, and I think if anything we&apos;d be pretty hopeful if (values were) maintained,&quot; he said.  
There was every indication that factors would bode well for Australia, with good signs on commodity values, cattle prices, the rising export trade to the Middle East and the growing Korean market, he said.  
&quot;The biggest driving factor we&apos;ll have is seasons and what happens in terms of stock numbers,&quot;  
Mr O&apos;Connell said.  
Sydney-based rural agent Chris Meares, of Meares &amp; Associates, said off-farm buyers had hardened their attitude towards property purchases, and in particular rural property.  
This year was likely to be tougher for vendors, and their expectations would not always be met.  
&quot;If you look at that in the cold light of day and what it means in dollar terms, I reckon it will be anywhere from par to 10 to 15 per cent less, that&apos;s for good country,&quot; Mr Meares said.  
&quot;Other country, marginal country, will be quite difficult to sell, based on vendor expectations being unrealistic.&quot;  
Overly high expectations were starting to be a problem.  
&quot;Everyone is saying we expect to get the maximum price, and it&apos;s not there,&quot; Mr Meares said.  
As ever, seasonal conditions would be a big factor this year, he said.  
The NSW rural land market would be pretty tough this year.  
&quot;When you look at rural in comparison to other sectors in the property market, it is still stacking up pretty well,&quot; he said.  
&quot;The one area that we are competing against very much at the moment is the equities market, stocks and shares, and there&apos;s a lot of people who have got money in there who are loathe to take it out at the moment, while it&apos;s still bubbling along.&quot;  
Landmark&apos;s Mr O&apos;Connell agreed the strong stock market was a factor in the current rural market.  
&quot;It does compete for funds,&quot; he said. &quot;One of the reasons I think we were fairly successful in the last couple of years is that two years ago the share market wasn&apos;t performing that well.  
&quot;A lot of people moved into property again, and they tended to focus more on it.&quot;  
The number of rural listings this year would depend on rain, Mr O&apos;Connell said.  
&quot;Queensland is getting the best wet they have had for a few seasons,&quot; he said.  
Northern and coastal areas were nearly back to their previously common 1200mm rainfall.  
&quot;But a lot of central and southern NSW and the Riverina is still very dry,&quot; he said.  
&quot;I think the banks will be watching very carefully the guys who haven&apos;t performed as well because of seasons -- they will be a bit nervous.&quot;  
There were not many rural properties unsold from last year, Mr O&apos;Connell said, &quot;apart from one or two where it is still very dry&quot;.  
&quot;Mostly the stocks have depleted a bit, so that&apos;s always a good sign, and when we get new listings, we should get inquiry.&quot;

WHILE farmers in parts of Australia are in their fifth straight year of drought, the giant Australian Agricultural Co is trying to clean up on bargain prices for cattle that farmers cannot feed.   
But it has warned it could be forced to make a writedown of its herd if low cattle prices since last year persist due to drought.   
AACo, which runs 560,000 head of cattle across almost 8millionha throughout Queensland and the Northern Territory, said its operations were largely unaffected by the dry conditions that had hit huge areas of Australia&apos;s farming districts.   
&quot;Unlike the southern half of Australia, the majority of AACo&apos;s properties are experiencing an above-average season with ample supply of pasture and stock water,&quot; chief executive Don Mackay said. For AACo, the drought is more opportunity than disaster, as drought-stricken farmers selling off distressed cattle force down their price.   
Chief financial officer Stephen Toms said the company was looking to acquire &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of cattle at drought-affected prices, which it would then fatten up using excess stores of feed it had accumulated.   
A lack of pasture in many southern grazing districts has led farmers to feed cattle on grain, but the effect of drought on this year&apos;s grain crop has led to huge increases in feed prices, leaving many with no choice but to sell their animals.   
The East Coast Young Cattle Index, a market indicator of Australian cattle sale prices, has slumped from $3.80 per kilo in August to a 3 1/2-year low of $2.67 earlier this month, a decline of almost 30 per cent.   
&quot;It&apos;s an opportunity for us to maximise the sales of our live export animals and buy store cattle a bit cheaper to use our surplus feed on,&quot; Mr Toms said.   
Store cattle are those not fattened for slaughter. Mr Mackay also said AACo had secured forward contracts over its grain requirements until September 2007, which ensured it could buy grain for less than the prices being charged on the spot market.   
But with the value of AACo&apos;s herd being calculated according to market prices for its annual accounts, the drought could affect headline earnings for the 12 months to the end of December.   
&quot;While the geographic positioning of the company has helped mitigate the impact of recent downward national price movements, the company nonetheless will remain sensitive to store cattle market prices used at balance date to value the trading cattle portion of the herd,&quot; Mr Mackay said.   
The company was unable to forecast what effect the price movement might have on its bottom line, saying cattle prices could move significantly before the end of the year in response to seasonal rainfall.

STOCKS were down across the agricultural sector yesterday as Australia&apos;s drought led the US Department of Agriculture to slash global grain production forecasts.   
Grain handling and storage company GrainCorp led the charge southwards, after warning that it expected to take delivery of just 2-4 million tonnes over the 2006-07 harvest, down from the 10.7 million tonnes received from the previous crop.   
Managing director Tom Keene said grain growers in much of eastern Australia, GrainCorp&apos;s area of operation, were facing a bleak year.   
&quot;Despite strong planting, there has been no decent rain since August across the eastern wheat belt,&quot; he said. Farmers were likely to bale their crops into straw or allow livestock to eat them straight out of the ground.   
GrainCorp shares closed 35c down at a five-week low of $7.31, a decline of almost 5 per cent.   
AWB, which operates the single desk bulk wheat export monopoly, was also hard hit, sliding 17c to close at $2.78 after hitting an all-time low of $2.76 earlier in the session.   
AWB has forecast a wheat crop of 12-15 million tonnes this summer, down from 24 million the previous summer, but private sector analysts are tipping a crop of no more than 11 million tonnes, the smallest since the drought of 2002-03.   
AWB shares have fallen as much as 57 per cent from the high of $6.41 they hit in January, as damaging revelations concerning the company&apos;s payment of $300 million in bribes to Saddam Hussein&apos;s regime emerged from the Cole inquiry.   
Prime Minister John Howard indicated yesterday that AWB International, the AWB subsidiary that operates the single desk, could lose its monopoly as a result of the findings of the Cole commission, which is due to report next month.   
&quot;The Cole commission will be reporting very soon and there could well be implications ... in relation to the AWB and AWB International as a result of that report,&quot; he told parliament during question time.   
AWB has sought to prepare itself for an eventual dismantling of the single desk by diversifying into rural merchandising and offshore trading of grain from other countries. But losing the single desk would remove a reliable source of cash flow from the management fees paid to AWB for handling the sale of the &quot;national pool&quot; of wheat.   
ABB Grain, the South Australian grain handler and barley malting company that grew out of the former Australian Barley Board, was down 13c to $6.39.   
Futuris, which supplies crop finance and farm inputs such as seed and fertiliser through its network of Elders rural merchandise stores, was down 4c to $1.88. Agricultural chemical group Nufarm fell 18c to $10.   
Incitec Pivot, which manufactures and supplies fertiliser, was down 22c to $24.97.   
Livestock producer Australian Agricultural Co fell 4.5c to $1.69 as investors calculated the added cost of feeding animals with increasingly high-priced grain as pasture disappears for want of moisture. The price of stockfeed-quality wheat has risen by 71 per cent over the past 12 months in line with increased demand.

SOUTHERN Australia might be in drought, but good rain in the northern part of the country has helped lift Australia&apos;s biggest cattle exporter to a profit 27 per cent higher than last year.   
The Australian Agricultural Company yesterday filed a net profit of $8.5 million for the six months to the end of June, and claimed it was on track to hit market forecasts of a full-year profit of $16-22 million.   
Managing director Don Mackay said there had been uncertainty in the past few months about the extent to which the US would re-enter the Japanese market. Australia had been filling the gap after US meat exports to Japan were hit by fears of mad cow disease.   
&quot;The speculation about a second coming of US product into Japan has affected confidence in both Japanese importers and Australian exporters, which created a great deal of uncertainty and therefore a lot of variation in price,&quot; he said.   
Since June 30, Japan had agreed to a new set of rules, with the expectation that volume would be low, he said. &quot;As a result of this, the market has recovered,&quot; Mr Mackay said.   
The low level of cattle prices had a dampening effect on the company&apos;s first-half performance, but since June the there had been a steady improvement in prices, which had gone up about 5 per cent since June 30.   
&quot;The excellent rainfall during the season extended two months longer than normal and this has delayed revenue-gathering activities into the second half,&quot; he said. Earlier this year, AACo entered the premium beef market with the purchase of the Wagyu stud breeding herd as well as moving to full ownership of the Chefs Partner business in April.   
&quot;The company expects the combined beef brands and Chefs Partner business to grow during the next six months. With Chefs now being an accredited exporter of beef, strong growth is expected from expansion into the Asian and US markets.&quot;   
To help fund its move into the Wagyu business, the company sold the glamorous Wrotham Park station in far north Queensland for $53.5 million, which was $4.9 million ahead of its valuation in December 2005.   
AACo shares were steady yesterday at $1.87.

			<TEXT>A VERY large ``for sale&apos;&apos; sign hangs over about 1 per cent of the Australian land mass yesterday, as Futuris Corp sells its substantial stake in the highly successful but under-appreciated beef business.   
Australian Agricultural Co is the nation&apos;s second oldest company. It owns our biggest beef herd by a country kilometre, with 630,000 cattle, living on 24 prime cattle stations in the monsoonal north.   
Not only is AACo relatively drought-proof but it is also at the mid-point of the strategy to transform itself into a globally pre-eminent beef business by 2015.   
And as each year goes by, chief executive Don Mackay looks ever more certain to achieve that ambition.   
So, it might not be immediately transparent why Futuris has decided that its 43 per cent of this already international-scale enterprise would be better off in someone else&apos;s hands.   
The bigger question here, though, is not why Camp Futuris wants out but, rather, why now?   
These are, after all, delicate days in the meat business and there is a fear, especially on the AACo side of the boundary, that another unique Australian asset might well end up being flogged off at a discount to its long-term value.   
Futuris, though, has more immediate concerns on its plate. Strategic plays in forestry and, more speculatively, in broadband have resulted in the potential for comparatively heavy capital requirements soon.   
At the same time, the company continues to be frustrated by the failure of the investment market to properly reflect its 43 per cent share of AACo&apos;s $700 million market capitalisation in the Futuris share price.   
Releasing, say, $300 million from AACo would buttress the balance sheet and allow for a market re-rating that would reduce Futuris&apos;s cost of capital.   
That the share price of both Futuris and AACo appreciated after yesterday&apos;s announcement suggests this move to a final uncoupling will release value on both sides of the equation.   
Since the company returned AACo to the market in 2002, the Futuris stake has been regarded as an uncomfortable overhang and a cause of illiquidity in the stock.   
Nonetheless, there is a case to be made here that Futuris is acting a tad pre-emptively in mandating Citigroup and Caliburn to sell the stake.   
It seems a second consecutive dry spring has, in a perverse way, acted to depress meat prices. Continued -- Page 40   
From Page 39   
Eastern state farmers, struggling to deal with the drought and the resulting effect on wheat prices and beef feedstock, have been flooding market yards with cattle.   
This is hurting AACo&apos;s immediate prospects but will be a boon in the medium term, the company thinks, because beef prices are going to bounce back very hard.   
If there is a sustained break in the eastern dry, then they will rebound very quickly indeed, as farmers withhold stock and attempt to re-establish their herds.   
And if, as the Aussie poet says, the ``Hanrahans&apos;&apos; are right and this drought ``don&apos;t break&apos;&apos;, then the sustainability of eastern herds will be further undermined and AACo&apos;s 630,000 strong herd will become ever more valuable.   
Coincidentally, Woolworths chief executive Michael Luscombe yesterday provided some insight into the difficulties of the meat market during a briefing on his quarterly sales figures.   
In describing how difficult it is currently to anticipate meat prices, Luscombe observed that yardings for beef in October jumped 13 per cent, as eastern farmers de-stocked.   
Luscombe noted that wheat prices had rocketed $500 per tonne and that beef cattle would usually eat three-quarters of a tonne in feedlot.   
But should rains come soon, animals destined for market would be held back and prices would surge, Luscbome says.   
Futuris and its advisers, Caliburn and Citigroup, maintain that the short-term prospects will play little in the value assumptions here.   
They maintain that grabbing 43 per cent of AACo in one fell swoop is a once in a lifetime opportunity and that buyers will look beyond the short-term market in preparing their valuations.   
That is a fair view but it is also worth pointing out that we heard the same sort of talk at the opening of the ill-starred Coles auction.   
The challenge for AACo is going to be ensuring that Futuris&apos;s desire for a deal does not result in effective control of this business passing at less than value.   
Oil still a premium   
ANYONE still hanging on to the strange idea BHP Billiton should cash out of the oil game should grab yesterday&apos;s quarterly production report, a pen and an envelope and do some sums with me.   
By the end of this calendar year, BHP will have started bringing on 152,000 barrels a day of new production capacity, with a further 17,000 barrels a day by the end the first quarter of calendar 2008.   
All told, then, BHP will be pumping out new oil production of near enough to 170,000 barrels a day by the end of calendar 2008.   
BHP, which produced 116 million barrels of oil last year, is expected to produce around 135 million or so in 2008.   
Now, I am here to tell you that represents a serious kick in earnings, given oil prices continue to travel at circa $US80 a barrel or more.   
It is worth recalling that BHP booked an average oil price of $US63.87 a barrel in fiscal 2007 and $US61.90 the year before.   
The way the numbers stack up on my envelope is that, all things being equal (and given this is the petroleum business, you know they will not be), BHP&apos;s new production has the potential to generate something like $US10 billion in revenue by the time it reaches target rates of production.   
Which means what? Well, last year BHP Petroleum generated EBIT of $US3 billion from revenues which topped $US5.5 billion.   
The news for BHP shareholders is a little less encouraging, mind, at Olympic Dam.   
While we outsiders try to get our heads around the idea that OD might well be the biggest base metals discovery in history, BHP seems to be struggling to come to terms with the here and now, which is the underground mining muddle built by WMC.   
Putting aside the unhappy impact of unscheduled smelter maintenance on metal production, the fact is that declining copper grades mean that the OD team is moving more materials than ever to maintain the sort of mill throughput that ensures it can hit production targets.   
When you are running a gold-plated underground operation like OD, you just don&apos;t want to go moving rock that you don&apos;t need to.   
On another matter, BHP has now formally sought leave to appeal to the High Court over the great Pilbara railway poaching case. Alas poor regular readers, you will be reading yet more on the attempt by Fortescue Metals via the National Competition Council to secure declared access to a $1 billion railway built by and for BHP shareholders.

			<TEXT>The company has posted a net profit of $5.9 million and remains `very positive&apos;   
BEEF producer Australian Agricultural Company says its full-year results will benefit from a return of normal weather patterns and strong world demand for quality beef.   
However, the stronger Australian dollar and uncertainty over the price and volume of US beef going to the Korean and Japanese markets are likely to have a negative impact.   
AACo yesterday reported a net profit for the first half of 2007 of $5.9 million -- down on the result in the prior corresponding period of $8.5 million.   
However, the first-half result in 2006 included a $6 million tax benefit related to the sale of AACo&apos;s Wrotham Park station.   
Operating earnings before interest and tax rose to $12.5 million, from $7.5 million, due to a lower cattle valuation markdown and more cost-effective herd management.   
&quot;The full-year result, as always, will be heavily influenced by market pricing at the year end,&quot; AACo managing director Don Mackay said.   
Any of several competing influences could affect short-term cattle prices through to December.   
&quot;The season (rainfall) has been good to date and there is an expectation of an improvement of conditions across Australia as we move out of the El Nino phase,&quot; Mr Mackay said.   
Unseasonal winter rains in June would assist production in Queensland and some parts of the Northern Territory and help cut supplementary feed costs in the second half.   
Demand for beef around the world remained strong and was outstripping supply.   
The size of the US herd was falling and high grain costs were affecting the placement of cattle into feedlots.   
Negative factors affecting AACo included uncertainty caused by US meat packers struggling to comply with protocols in Japan and Korea.   
Uncertainty of re-entry by US producers into the Korean and Japanese markets was resulting in traders pressuring suppliers such as AACo to suppress prices on the basis that the US would supply cheaper beef.   
Mr Mackay said the high dollar had placed significant pressure on AACo and was likely to continue to do so.   
AACo was covered against higher grain prices well into next year, but costs would rise as more expensive grain was added to AACo&apos;s inventory.   
Mr Mackay said AACo had a &quot;very positive&quot; view of the market in the medium to long term and saw opportunities in Asia and the US for high-value products.   
&quot;We are fully examining other opportunities that flow from things such as climate change, which can include carbon sequestration and also development opportunities of farming in northern Australia,&quot; he said.   
Land was becoming scarcer and would eventually be allocated towards highest-value usage. There was a high expectation that the Queensland Government would allow other types of farming on land previously allocated for pastoral use.   
AACo was &quot;actively pursuing&quot; ways that it could best take advantage of any changes.   
Mr Mackay said the first half of the year had been a period of consolidation after the sale of Wrotham Park and the acquisition of the Anthony Lagoon and Evan Downs stations and the Westholme wagyu stud.   
The general cattle market had been quite disappointing, although AACo&apos;s prices had held up quite well as a result of forward selling.   
Southern cattle producers had swamped the market with cattle in late 2006, following severe drought and lack of water. However, general parity had now been broadly re-established.   
Although seasonal conditions had been average or above average on most of AACo&apos;s properties, late rains in the north delayed mustering and sales.   
AACo had also held back selling some grass-fed cattle into the soft market.

			<TEXT>Rural   
GREG Paramor says there is some irony in him joining the board of Australian Agricultural Co, as his father worked as an Elders stock and station agent for 25 years.   
Through Futuris Corp, Elders now owns about 44 per cent of AACo.   
Growing up in rural Western Australia, Greg Paramor -- now managing director of Mirvac Group -- had no idea that one day he would be appointed to the board of the nation&apos;s most celebrated agricultural company.   
He no doubt understood the livestock business, but never could have foreseen carbon trading, the enterprise that AACo now sees as a key part of its future.   
Even less could Mr Paramor have imagined that he would become the expert brought in to show the company how to profit from the brave new greenhouse world.   
Mr Paramor said he was drawn to AACo because it was &quot;a unique Australian icon and one of the oldest companies in the land&quot;.   
There were no plans for AACo and Mirvac to work together &quot;and that wasn&apos;t why I was approached&quot;.   
&quot;Rural is about the only area of property that Mirvac is not involved in, but it&apos;s an area I have always been keenly interested in from both the cattle production and general farming/grazing perspective,&quot; he said.   
&quot;Then there&apos;s the area of sustainability and also funds.   
&quot;AACo has a unique model and I think it&apos;s something that can be leveraged quite significantly, so whether I can assist there -- we&apos;ll wait and see.&quot;   
Mr Paramor said Mirvac&apos;s Australian Sustainability Investment Fund owned plantation timber and recently started trading carbon credits on the global market.   
AACo chairman Nick Burton Taylor said Mr Paramor had property securitisation knowledge that would greatly assist AACo as it pursued carbon trading opportunities.   
Despite the federal Government currently excluding agriculture from the carbon trading regime, Mr Burton Taylor said AACo -- which controls 1.2 per cent of Australia&apos;s land mass, mostly in areas with rising rainfall -- was positioning itself to play a role in future.   
With 35 years&apos; experience in property and funds management, Mr Paramor could advise AACo about &quot;how our assets can be put in a form to attract interest from investor markets&quot;.   
&quot;Greg has a deep understanding of the way property markets work and how to produce investment products out of assets,&quot; Mr Burton Taylor said.   
AACo planned to develop carbon abatement projects, or &quot;carbon sinks&quot;, he said.   
While the federal Government and business leaders continue to debate the terms of any future carbon trading scheme, last month a central Queensland grazier became one of the first to cash in on the sector when he sold the carbon credits from his 3500ha at Moura to miner Rio Tinto for $1million.   
AACo&apos;s focus on northern Australia, much of which has had above-average rainfall in recent times, has insulated it from direct effects of the current drought, although the company&apos;s bottom line has been affected by a general drop in cattle prices as a result of the drought elsewhere.   
The company posted a $10.1 million annual profit in February.   
The ASX this week issued AACo with a price query, after its share price spiked more than 10 per cent to a record high of $2.88.   
Company secretary Bruce Bennett told the ASX yesterday the company had no pending announcements but he pointed to widespread rain in eastern Australia last week, saying this was likely to lead to rising cattle prices and falling grain prices.   
AACo is the nation&apos;s second-oldest company (after the Bank of NSW, now Westpac), having been founded in 1824 by royal assent of George IV with a charter based on that of the East India Company.   
It was listed on the ASX in 2001, with Peter Holmes a Court as chief executive.   
Lists of its early governors read like a Who&apos;s Who of business and agriculture in Australia and Britain, and included the merino breeding Macarthur family, the governor of The Bank of England and various MPs.   
Since the break-up of the Stanbroke Pastoral Co empire in 2004, AACo has been the nation&apos;s largest landholder and cattle grazier, and now runs about 560,000 head. AACo failed in its bid to buy the Stanbroke properties when they were first sold in 2003 and AACo then launched litigation against vendor AMP Life over the matter.   
Shareholders at AACo&apos;s annual general meeting in Brisbane last month heard that AMP had recently paid the $10 million settlement agreed between the two companies, and it would be booked in the current year, with a 2 per cent special dividend paid. But the saga had been difficult for the AACo board, Mr Burton Taylor said.   
&quot;I&apos;d never want to do it again,&quot; he said after the AGM.   
&quot;It was a very intense exercise and intensely time-consuming.   
&quot;Hopefully it won&apos;t ever arise again.&quot;

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIAN Agricultural Co yesterday unveiled plans to become a major player in the emerging carbon market, despite being shut out of carbon trading policy talks by the federal Government.   
AACo chairman Nick Burton Taylor said the cattle producer&apos;s huge landbank would allow it to become a significant developer of carbon abatement projects.   
News of the plans came as AACo admitted that its profits may be hit by the strong dollar and falling cattle prices, sending its shares down by 1.5 per cent.   
AACo, Australia&apos;s biggest cattle rancher, owns and manages 1.2 per cent of Australia&apos;s land mass.   
&quot;Carbon trading systems, creation of carbon sinks, planting of forests or the production of ethanol and alternative energy sources all have the common requirement and need for land,&quot; Mr Burton Taylor told AACo&apos;s annual general meeting in Brisbane yesterday.   
He said that, like other agricultural companies, AACo saw itself as a &quot;key component&quot; in long-term solutions to climate change.   
&quot;It is unfortunate that federal government policy has precluded the agricultural sector as an active participant in the development of carbon trading policies,&quot; he said.   
The comment came as AACo chief executive officer Don Mackay warned that if cattle prices did not improve, the company&apos;s earnings would be hurt.   
A lack of rainfall in parts of Australia has led to benchmark cattle prices falling 3.8 per cent from the year&apos;s high of $3.48 on March 15.   
Mr Mackay said: &quot;If current prices, although improving, were sustained past the end of June, they may affect inventory values and therefore reported earnings at this time under the mark to market accounting standards.&quot;   
AACo shares fell 4c to $2.56 yesterday.   
Mr Mackay said AACo&apos;s properties were in good condition &quot;on average&quot;, although its cattle stations in southern parts of Queensland have had little or no rain.   
Demand for beef internationally remains strong, although there is some pressure on the company in the Korean market as that country resumes imports of US beef following a more than three-year ban.   
AACo also announced yesterday that it had hired property industry veteran Greg Paramor to its board.   
Mr Burton Taylor said that Mr Paramor, managing director of Mirvac Group, brought good knowledge of property securitisation and could advise AACo &quot;how our assets can be put in a form to attract interest from investor markets&quot;.   
But the chairman insisted that putting the company&apos;s string of vast cattle stations into a property trust and creating a stapled entity, as many other property-related companies had done, was not on the agenda.   
&quot;We talk all the time about whether we should have a stapled trust,&quot; Mr Burton Taylor said.   
The board had decided that shareholder interest was best served for now by a single entity.   
Mr Paramor said he was drawn to AACo because it was &quot;a unique Australian icon and one of the oldest companies in the land&quot;.

			<TEXT>Funds management   
BEEF producer Australian Agricultural Co is one of just 35 stocks to be included in a new global fund launched in Australia yesterday.   
The DWS Global Equity Agribusiness Fund, described as the first of its kind in the world, is designed to capture the growing demand for food in a world where population is rising and the amount of arable land available is shrinking.   
AACo fits the bill because it is well positioned to capture the growing demand for protein, especially from Asia as the region becomes increasingly affluent.   
The selected companies range from medium-sized to large companies and come from developed and emerging economies. The constant factor is that they all play an integral part in the global food supply chain.   
Land/property companies, plantations, producers of fertilisers, seeds, farm machinery and specialist support businesses, including logistics and agriculture finance companies, are in the portfolio.   
Andrew Fay, chief executive of Deutsche Asset Management in Australia, said these companies, like AACo, had been selected on the basis of valuation and other criteria which set them apart from their peers.   
Mr Fay said agribusiness stocks were subject to cycles influenced by droughts and overproduction, but the spread of the companies -- from 17 countries and the different ends of the production spectrum -- would level out some of the volatilities.   
He said the fund was a long-term investment option, based on the changing demographics of the world.   
The global population was projected to grow to 9.3 billion by 2050 from 6.5 billion now, while land available for crop cultivation was expected to remain at around 1.5billion hectares to 2050.   
China and India were driving demand for food, just as they were driving demand for metals and energy. And protein consumption was set to surge as diets changed with rising incomes.   
More livestock would mean more feedstock, thus reinforcing the effect, according to the fund manager.   
Mr Fay said it was not just food. Crops such as potatoes, sugar, corn and wheat would be used to produce alternative fuels such as ethanol.   
The initial list of 35 stocks would eventually be expanded to 60 as more investment flowed into the fund.   
Deutsche&apos;s New York-based investment team, which runs the trust, has shortlisted 200-250 stocks from global stock markets for future inclusion in its portfolio.   
Currently, it has a weighting of over 3percent in Australia, which incidentally represents just 1.8 per cent of the global equities market capitalisation.   
The global fund manages $US186million ($235 million).   
In time, Mr Fay hopes to raise $100million in Australia. He said the fund was intended for clients of private banking, but pre-launch marketing had found that the market was deeper than that. He said some of the large financial planning groups which understood the success stories of India and China could see the logic of this particular fund.   
The value of the fund was expected to grow to between $US4 billion and $US5 billion over time.   
Deutsche Asset Management launched its global agribusiness fund in Singapore in September and it has since been rolled out to Europe and Hong Kong.   
Australia is the fourth market and Mr Fay said the fund would soon be launched in Japan and the US.   
Since September, the fund had performed well ahead of its broad benchmark, the MSCI World Index -- delivering 17.7 per cent against the MSCI World Index&apos;s 9.6 per cent.   
In fact, until February 2006, Deutsche operated a test portfolio (with many of the same stocks in the current portfolio) over three years.   
Mr Fay said that the returns in one year were 25.5 per cent (versus MSCI World&apos;s 11.3 per cent). Over two years, they were 87.8 per cent (MSCI 22.5 per cent), and over three years, they were 257 per cent compared with MSCI&apos;s 73.9 per cent.   
But Mr Fay said past returns were no guarantee of future performance.   
He pointed out, however, that the agribusiness sector had gone through several natural calamities in recent years, including Asia&apos;s tsunami in 2004, Hurricane Katrina in the US, drought in Australia and a heatwave in Europe.

			<TEXT>Results   
AUSTRALIAN Agricultural Co&apos;s share price soared 6 per cent yesterday even though the company announced a 40 per cent drop in profit.   
The $10.1 million full-year result for the nation&apos;s biggest cattle producer, down from $16.7 million previously, was stronger than some analysts expected.   
Some said the lower profit was partly due to the phasing in of stringent AIFRS valuation requirements on live cattle assets, rather than an accurate reflection of AACo&apos;s performance.   
But fluctuating cattle prices as a result of the drought in southern states, and rising costs due to an expanding business, did bite the bottom line.   
Chief executive Don Mackay said AACo performed well on many significant indicators, and the drought&apos;s damage to earnings could have been worse if not for the &quot;diverse, northern-focused operation&quot;.   
&quot;Seasonally, the company had a generally good year, with excellent rain on the large northern properties, with below average rain only affecting the southern properties,&quot; he said.   
AACo achieved operational improvements including lifting production 9 per cent from 67 million kilograms to 73 million kilograms, lifting its calving rate from 67 per cent to 71 and growing its meat business by 95 per cent to $75 million in sales.   
Meanwhile, AACo soon could be heading back to court, claiming damages from AMP Life over the 2004 sell-off of Stanbroke Pastoral Co, Australia&apos;s largest rural property disposal.   
AACo -- which at that time had Peter Holmes a Court at the helm -- claims it made higher bids than the $490 million that won the portfolio for a consortium of investors and Queensland cattlemen. The companies have been ordered into a mediation meeting this week, but the matter has been listed for hearing at the Federal Court in Sydney on February 19.   
Yesterday, AACo said its 43 per cent drop in earnings before interest and tax was &quot;impacted by herd revaluation&quot;.   
The 10 per cent rise in costs was due to fuel price increases and the larger breeding capacity.   
Net assets rose 4.1 per cent to $582 million, and gross assets rose 15 per cent to $1.09 billion.   
AACo said that before adjustments for herd revaluation, it had &quot;significantly outperformed&quot; the previous year on revenue and EBIT.   
Mr Mackay said good returns from beef cattle production had contributed to the continuing appreciation in value of AACo&apos;s &quot;quality, large-scale&quot; properties.   
AACo was not actively looking at any properties or businesses, Mr Mackay told an analysts&apos; briefing, and speculation that it was running the ruler over Australian Meat Holdings was &quot;just that: speculation&quot;.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIAN Agricultural Co, the nation&apos;s largest cattle producer, blamed a mix of drought, lower cattle prices and high feed costs for a loss of $2.2 million for the first half of 2008, against a $5.9 million profit for the previous corresponding period.
Stephen Toms, who yesterday was confirmed as CEO, said however that the full-year number would be better because of a turnaround in the seasons and a weakening Australian dollar.
Looking back, he said: ``Cattle prices in the last couple of years have been depressed, mainly due to drought in the southern part of Australia up until this year.&apos;&apos;
Mr Toms explained that a large number of poor-condition cattle on the market had depressed prices. But after the recent rain, cattle farmers were keeping their stock and prices had risen.
``We expect if the price stays up, then the second half would be quite good.&apos;&apos; He said prices had risen from $3.15 to $3.40 a live kilo in the first half of 2008 to $3.53 a kilo in recent weeks.
Mr Toms said the falling Australian dollar translated directly into better gross margins in cattle.
``That means Australia as an industry will be more competitive on the world beef scene, with a lower entry price into Korea and Japan, and into the US itself which are our three big markets.&apos;&apos;
While AACo sells some meat in Australia, ``our money is made in export. We are much more comfortable now the dollar is dropping away, and the market dynamics are starting to kick in,&apos;&apos; Mr Toms said.
Revenue for the first half was $123.6 million, down slightly on the figure for the prior corresponding period of $124.2 million. The company declared a dividend of 7c a share, payable in mid-October.
Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) lifted 28 per cent to $16 million.
The cash flow last year included a net $8.8 million settlement from AMP, from litigation over the sale of the Stanbroke Pastoral Group.
The past year had seen some changes for Australia&apos;s oldest cattle company.
Plans by Futuris, which has a 42 per cent stake in AACo, to sell the company foundered. Futuris chief executive Les Wozniczka has announced he will resign his position at Futuris when a replacement is found. He remains on AACo&apos;s four-member board.
Don Mackay, a well-respected cattleman with a long history in the industry, resigned as AACo&apos;s CEO in January.
Then in May, Futuris dumped chairman Nick Burton Taylor, and two board members resigned in protest.
Mr Toms said the strategic direction of the company, which he described as ``a concentrated beef protein producer&apos;&apos;, had ``morphed a bit from where it was before, to be more realistic about what is happening in the world in terms of other agriculture, other proteins, and competing proteins like soybeans and vegetable proteins&apos;&apos;.
He pointed out that neither of the two new members, conservationist Phillip Toyne and peanut grower and commercial lawyer Brett Heading, was a cattleman.
``They are bringing different perspectives from what we had before,&apos;&apos; Mr Toms said.
``We did have an inordinate focus on just being the best beef producer in the world, but I think it distorted our thinking as a company.&apos;&apos;
Mr Toms said the company, which operates 24 cattle stations and two feedlots on 7million hectares, or more than 1per cent of Australia&apos;s land mass, was looking at diversifying into growing protein crops and expanding into the dairy industry as well as carbon trading.

FUTURIS Ltd yesterday routed the board of Australian Agricultural Co, resulting in the exit of all the cattle company&apos;s independent directors.
Futuris used its 43 per cent voting power to eject Nick Burton Taylor as AACo chairman, and newly re-elected directors Greg Paramor and Chris Roberts resigned in protest.
Futuris chief executive Les Wozniczka and director Charles Bright were the only remaining directors at the end of the two and a half hour annual general meeting in Brisbane.
After a special board meeting last night, Mr Wozniczka said Mr Bright had been appointed acting chairman, chief financial officer Stephen Toms acting chief executive, and Phillip Toyne had become an independent director.
Mr Toyne is a former chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation.
Futuris executive Michael Sadlon said the company was unhappy about the unsuccessful sale process for its AACo stake -- which ended two weeks ago.
The decision to remove the chairman ``has not been taken lightly&apos;&apos;, Mr Sadlon told the meeting.
He said the interest shown in AACo had not translated into executable proposals being put to Futuris or other AACo shareholders, but he did not want to reveal details because of ``confidentiality obligations&apos;&apos;.
``Futuris is not satisfied that AACo will have the unified board it needs under the current chairman&apos;s leadership,&apos;&apos; he said.
Pressed by shareholders at the end of the meeting to reveal the plans of Futuris, Mr Wozniczka said it was not on the market.
``Offers can be made for AACo,&apos;&apos; he said. ``We are not seeking such offers, we are not encouraging such offers.&apos;&apos;
Mr Burton Taylor and his family control about 3 per cent of the AACo register.
After the meeting he said he believed the actions of Futuris were a way to ``throw the company into play; a destablising tactic&apos;&apos;. But its actions were not good for the welfare of AACo and its staff, and were akin to taking a wrecking ball to it.
Mr Burton Taylor refuted any suggestion he or the other independent directors had sought to obstruct the sale of the Futuris stake. AACo was ``energised and focused&apos;&apos; and he hoped it would remain so.
Numerous shareholders and each of the independent directors -- including former deputy prime minister Tim Fischer, who previously announced his resignation for personal reasons -- spoke in support of Mr Burton Taylor.
Before the rout, Mr Burton Taylor announced various initiatives by AACo, including plans to establish a $500 million property trust to hold the company&apos;s vast pastoral portfolio, which covers more than 1 per cent of Australia&apos;s land mass.
Mr Wozniczka last night poured water on that proposal, saying ``in principle it has some merit&apos;&apos; but he was sceptical about how it would play out.
Futuris put the interests of AACo uppermost, and the position of the company today was a result of the support Futuris had given it over the past 12 years.
``No one has more to gain or lose from the performance of the company than Futuris,&apos;&apos; Mr Wozniczka said.
Mr Burton Taylor also stepped down yesterday as acting chief executive, a position he has held since the departure of Don Mackay in January.

			<TEXT>The company&apos;s stock copped a hiding this week
FUTURIS boss Les Wozniczka reckons the style and timing of Futuris&apos;s failed bid to sell its stake in Australian Agricultural Company should have been different, but that structural issues contributed to the bruising the stock copped in the market this week.
As he surveys the fallout from the aborted sale of AACo, Wozniczka says he would do things very differently if, and when, he tries again to sell a division of his regional services empire Futuris, from the timing of the announcement to the tenor of negotiations.
The former investment banker saw at least 15 per cent wiped off the value of Futuris shares this week as investors punished him for abandoning the sale of Futuris&apos;s 43 per cent stake in beef producer AACo.
The announcement on Tuesday came seven months after Futuris, which generates income from agriculture through subsidiary Elders, forestry through ICT and telecommunications through a stake iiNet, announced it hoped to sell its $300 million-plus stake in the ``land-rich, cash-poor&apos;&apos; asset because of its consistent failure to translate value into the company&apos;s stock price.
Wozniczka tells The Australian that the lessons from the failed sale of AACo are not for Futuris alone, but signal a greater problem for Australia&apos;s agriculture sector.
``The market has penalised us for holding AACo and there&apos;s an inconsistency there,&apos;&apos; he says.
``Part of that comes from the realisation that, as good as AACo might be as an investment, there is a desire by the market to see those funds deployed through other Futuris activities.
``One of the challenges we&apos;ve got in AACo is that the growth in capital -- the land appreciation -- doesn&apos;t come through our accounts.
``I think this is a real challenge for building an agricultural sector through the Australian stock market because if the only way to demonstrate returns is to sell the asset, then it&apos;s going to be very difficult to grow large, agriculturally focused companies.&apos;&apos;
Despite criticism that the diversified industrial was asking too much for AACo, Wozniczka says the planned sale collapsed under the weight of uncertainty around the completion of the deal, turmoil in debt markets and the decision to publicly announce Futuris&apos;s intent to sell its stake.
``When you take all those things into account and the length of time that it was going on for, we really thought the better thing was to say, `Look, we&apos;ve been defeated by the markets; let&apos;s just move on&apos;,&apos;&apos; he says.
Wozniczka would be ``reluctant to repeat the process&apos;&apos; when and if Futuris tries to offload AACo again. ``We would either just not do it or do it as a private negotiation,&apos;&apos; he says.
``In hindsight the timing of the sale was also inappropriate; we should have waited for indications the credit market had settled down. But in October the sentiment was that the credit issues were isolated to the US and certain banking institutions.&apos;&apos;
Wozniczka says the strong sentiment in October that funds would be redirected to safe-haven assets such as AACo, which had high-quality property that had sustained its value over a long time, drove Futuris&apos;s decision to announce the planned sale late last year.
``Funds were accumulating in sovereign funds at a great rate, those funds were looking for places to invest their money and so it seemed -- the advice we had, and we had some of the best advisers that we could get with Citigroup and Caliburn -- was to go public and do it in the way that we did,&apos;&apos; he says.
``Once you take that decision, you&apos;re stuck with it.&apos;&apos;
Futuris&apos;s decision to abandon the sale of its holding in AACo comes a month after Elders and its joint-venture partner Optus were told by the new Labor Government that a billion-dollar contract awarded to the consortium by the former Coalition government to roll out broadband to regional areas of Australia would not be honoured, prompting Futuris to announce a $15 million writedown for this financial year as a result. The move also followed a shocking first half for the company as the drought hit Elders&apos; bottom line.
Despite copping a beating this week, Futuris, which will release its full-year results on August 14, expects earnings for 2007-08 to be at the top end of forecasts with underlying earnings before interest and tax of between $154 million to $183 million.
``We had an atrocious start in the first six months of this year but we&apos;ve backed ourselves that we still think we can at least match what we did last year and that means that our second-half performance will have to be by a long long way the best that we&apos;ve ever done,&apos;&apos; Wozniczka says.
``We&apos;ll have to do $75 million after tax for the second half. ``We&apos;ve never done that but we&apos;re confident of achieving that if we can get some things to go right for us.&apos;&apos;
Things are looking up so far, with better rainfall and grain deregulation taking place from July, a market Wozniczka says he wants to be very competitive in.
``We&apos;d like to go into that with more firepower in our balance sheet than we&apos;ve currently got today,&apos;&apos; he says.
Despite the optimism, the failure to move AACo off Futuris&apos;s books will have implications for the company.
The $300 million from the proposed sale had been slated to retire debt and to finance Futuris&apos;s growth strategy.
``We&apos;ll have to rethink some aspects of that,&apos;&apos; Wozniczka says. ``The fact that we will have less capital resources than we otherwise would have had if we had sold AACo means we&apos;ll have to fund more of our growth from within our businesses.
``So we&apos;ll be looking harder at our assets and our returns.&apos;&apos;
The failure to execute the deal also prompted broader questions about the future of Futuris, how it planned to regroup and what to do with a company that it didn&apos;t want but couldn&apos;t sell.
Wozniczka dismisses suggestions that Futuris&apos;s wide range of interests -- which include telecommunications, car parts and finance -- have spread the company&apos;s focus too thinly.
``It&apos;s been the diversity that has enabled us to produce profits and dividends and returns for shareholders over the past few years,&apos;&apos; he says.
``Many of our competitors have recorded losses and cut dividends completely.
``We&apos;ve always taken risks, some things have worked brilliantly, some things haven&apos;t, but we&apos;re still here, we&apos;re still performing well.
``You look at our earnings compared to other companies in the agricultural sector and we&apos;ve been making consistent profits in some pretty tough years,&apos;&apos; he says.
Why then, has the market been so punishing to Futuris?
``Well, that&apos;s the million-dollar question,&apos;&apos; Wozniczka says. ``I guess I have to take responsibility for not adequately communicating or selling our message.
``If we stopped our growth, our returns would improve significantly but whether that&apos;s really in the best interests of the company long term, I would doubt that.
``So we&apos;ve got to strike a balance there. I think in the current climate you&apos;re going to see us even work harder on returns, generating cash in the business.&apos;&apos;

			<TEXT>Wozniczka&apos;s long-term plan is to build a mammoth rural empire -- but he needs profits, too
EVENTS have conspired against Les Wozniczka this year, largely for reasons out of his control but -- crucially -- of his original creation.The Futuris boss has a loyal following in the market but given that his stock price is returning punters something like 7c in the dollar, you have to wonder why.
A profit downgrade earlier this week and the failed sale of its $300 million-plus stake in Australian Agricultural Co were the catalysts for an 11 per cent slide in the stock price to $1.87 a share, to bring the 12-month return to a negative 16.6 per cent.
AACo was put on the market for the logical reason that it was cash-poor and land-rich, and the values simply were not reflected in the Futuris stock price.
We might be heading into a rural boom right now, but the same logic that inspired the sale still applies -- and if you look further afield, it is not all blue sky.
US beef producers are back in Australia&apos;s key Asian markets, so competition hasn&apos;t disappeared.
Earlier in the year, the Optus-Futuris joint venture Opel was a victim of the new Government, with Communications Minister Stephen Conroy dumping a planned $1 billion subsidy to the companies.
Just why a rural services company was in a mobile phone joint venture is part of the reason the market is unimpressed with the company.
Former investment banker Wozniczka&apos;s plan to supply all things to farmers was inspired, but when you run public companies you are meant to earn a return on such investments.
The latter part is still a work in progress.
Today there will be some news from half-owned Amcom and its offshoot iiNet, with a $25 million capital raising for a West Australian acquisition.
But according to Les Woz, the news will not be material for Futuris.
He has a car parts business which makes everything from seats to steering wheels and is in the books at around $250 million.
This business has been on the market for as long as you care to remember, and is obviously still so.
There is the 32.4 per cent stake in Tasmanian farm group Websters which Les would love to convert into a controlling position, and the market would love to see better returns on the $400 million paid for the Integrated Tree Cropping Venture.
There is a synergy to all these assets and Les is better placed than anyone to explain Futuris&apos;s long-term plan to build a mammoth rural services empire.
After losing almost the entire upper echelon of his heartland business, Elders, last year -- including its highly regarded boss, Greg Hunt -- he has now restored it to full capacity under former ANZ banker Mike Guerin, according to the company.
Debt has increased this year to some $500 million with gearing rising from 19 to 25 per cent, which on anyone&apos;s criteria is still conservative.
For a cyclical business, with the drought broken and grain deregulation imminent, this should be the time for Futuris to show its wares.
But the empire is largely in the investment banker&apos;s head and on his whiteboard with little in the way of shareholder returns. Company chair Stephen Gerlach still supports management but has clearly drawn a line in the sand and wants more focus from here on. Let&apos;s hope that means returns -- more than grand plans and chasing every deal in town.
State of Origin
ORIGIN&apos;S Grant King took a break from talks in Sydney yesterday with BG&apos;s Sir Robert Wilson and Frank Chapman to explain just why he is demanding a higher price than the $14.70 cash bid on the table.
His Macquarie presentation was in effect a public rehashing of the same lines used in the confidential talks with the BG team earlier in the day.
Contrary to what was reported elsewhere, and as disclosed here six days ago, Wilson and Chapman arrived in Australia at the weekend to close the deal with their Origin counterparts Kevin McCann and the aforementioned King.
Wilson and Chapman have to head back to London for next week&apos;s BG annual meeting and presumably by then, at least, will have to let us know how the talks concluded. King was clearly delighted with the bid price, which, he noted at the Macquarie conference, took his company from being valued by the market as a utility on a price-earnings multiple to being valued as a long-life resources company on a discounted cash flow value.
If we bring that back to price-earnings multiple terms, that means a starting price of 32 times a share for the company, compared with its historical trading range around 16 to 22 times.
As King noted, if coal seam methane gas is valuable, then he sits on more of it than anyone else in Australia and, by definition, if gas prices rise, then so does the value of the gas and potential reserves.
King replayed for the benefit of the Macquarie audience the same lines he has been using on the BG team all week.
As to how the talks are faring and when they might conclude, all we know is that they are still going.
Oxiana-Zinifex gap wider
WHILE on the takeover trail -- and further to yesterday&apos;s note on the big trading in Oxiana -- the game is still on, with the gap between Oxiana and Zinifex widening dramatically.
This month Oxiana&apos;s stock price has increased by 12.3 per cent on big volume, and Zinifex by 7.4 per cent, which isn&apos;t the normal trade running into a scheme meeting to approve a merger.
Both sides say they don&apos;t know what is going on with the trade, and there seems to be no evidence of a predator like Xstrata on the loose.
In theory, if someone buys Oxiana, they would be required to buy Zinifex, but a conditional bid putting a big price on Oxiana would certainly tempt its board to walk from the Zinifex deal.
As at close of play last night, another theory was that Oxiana shareholders who were unhappy with the deal and disenfranchised by the deal structure might be the source of the share trading.
The way the scheme works, it is Oxiana buying Zinifex, so under Australian law it&apos;s only the latter shareholders who get to vote on the deal.
Numbers man
ACCOUNTING standard zealots have a rare opportunity to quiz the boss of the International Accounting Standards Board, Bob Garnett, who comes to town on May 30.
IFRIC chair Garnett will be the keynote speaker at a National Institute of Accountants seminar in Perth on that date.
Other speakers include Australian IASB member Warren McGregor, ASIC deputy accountant Doug Niven and KPMG partner Kris Peach.
For those who want a first-hand read on how financial instruments and the like are defined, the trip by the former Anglo American executive provides a great opportunity.

			<TEXT>Corporate Express (CXP) $5.61   
AS a supplier of everyday office items to business, Corporate Express looks vulnerable to any economic downturn. But chief stationer Grant Harrod offers a novel rationale for retaining faith in the diversified outfit.   
``We never raced up to the extent others did when the economy took off,&apos;&apos; says Harrod. ``Plenty of times I woke up and saw the copper price up 20 per cent and thought: wouldn&apos;t it be nice if we had gone up accordingly.&apos;&apos;   
In a shakier economy, reasons Harrod, Corporate Express won&apos;t have so far to fall as it never scaled Himalayan highs. The company also has the protection of its agnosticism: it doesn&apos;t have a skew to any particular sector or product.   
Having started out in stationery, Corporate Express has emerged as a one-stop supplier of office staples such as computer consumables, cleaning supplies, safety equipment and catering items. It will even top up the boardroom booze cabinet.   
These days, half the company&apos;s revenue comes from outside traditional pads and pens. ``It&apos;s all pretty non-discretionary,&apos;&apos; says Harrod. ``Our customers have to spend in all of these areas to run their businesses.&apos;&apos; Corporate Express&apos;s philosophy has been to lock its customers into long-term contracts and become their single supplier. The company has also emulated Coles and Woolworths by developing its private brands, which account for around one-third of sales.   
Corporate Express yesterday posted its 12th consecutive profit rise, but only just: calendar 2007 net earnings edged up a mere 0.6 per cent to $68 million.   
As is often the case, the bottom line is more of a bottom lie, in that Corporate Express debt-funded a $90 million share buyback. The EBIT result -- which disregards the higher interest bill -- rose a more convincing 6 per cent to $104 million.   
Not one for rash utterances, Harrod describes trading conditions as ``conducive to continued growth&apos;&apos;. So far at least, the Reserve Bank&apos;s official rate rises of November and this week have not resulted in stationary stationery.   
While Corporate Express is often compared with Wesfarmers (formerly Coles) Officeworks, there&apos;s really only a passing resemblance in that Officeworks sells through retail outlets, while Corporate Express does 74 per cent of its business online. Harrod sees only a muted impact if Wesfarmers proves it can run the show better, and he&apos;s similarly unfazed by Gerry Harvey&apos;s two-store stationery foray under the Ofis moniker.   
Corporate Express&apos;s main turnoff for investors is the mature feel of the business: while the company can chip away at winning a greater ``share of wallet&apos;&apos; of its existing customers, the only decent top-line growth will derive from acquisitions.   
With the exception of the Wesfarmers-dominated safety equipment segment, the sectors are fragmented. Nearest rivals are the foreign-owned Boise and Lyreco, but beyond those it&apos;s all small-fry stuff.   
Corporate Express has bought no fewer than 70 businesses in the last decade -- the most recent being the library supplies house Raeco -- and more acquisitions are on the agenda.   
Harrod doesn&apos;t expect the company to stray outside its existing products, or its home turf. ``We still have lots of opportunities in Australia and New Zealand and they are markets we know well.&apos;&apos;   
Criterion last rated Corporate Express an avoid at $7.10 on May 16 last year as it simply looked overvalued -- and we were right. Now that the stock&apos;s on a current earnings multiple of around 14, we&apos;ll upgrade to a long-term buy.   
Despite the buyback, Harrod says the company is still undergeared. The business throws off $70 million of free cash flow a year and has also targeted $70 million of savings over the next 12 months.   
While it&apos;s safe to assume there won&apos;t be a monstrous company transformation, one possibility is that the controlling Dutch shareholder, Corporate Express NV, either sells its stakes or buys out the minorities.   
Last October the Dutch denied any such intentions, but corporate strategy is a wonderfully fluid thing.   
Futuris (FCL) $2.01   
Australian Agricultural Co (AAC) $2.97   
ALL it takes is a few inches in the rain gauge and farmers are back in town buying new wellies and fertiliser, borrowing money and upgrading the tractor to a de-luxe cup-holder model. All of which trickles into the coffers of the rural conglomerate, which is starting to reap the benefit after a parched year to forget.   
Enthused Futuris chief Les Wozniczka describes yesterday&apos;s first-half results as ``overall a good start and the best outlook we have had for many years&apos;&apos;. Management won&apos;t really know how the full numbers look until after the winter cropping season but is comfortable with the market&apos;s full-year expectations (of a circa $107 million result).   
While the interim result fell 18 per cent, the absence of the (divested) property arm means the underlying result rose 18 per cent. The black ink spread across all operations, but the rebound was best felt across Elders Rural Services (merchanting) division.   
While rain is the simple explanation, one wonders whether Elders is also winning share from its arch-rival, AWB&apos;s Landmark. As of AWB&apos;s September full-year balance date, Landmark&apos;s earnings were little more than holding ground.   
As a portfolio of businesses, Futuris&apos;s cylinders rarely fire in harmony. But this time around even its odd-bod arm -- the car component market Futuris Auto -- is a decent profit generator.   
With a bit of luck -- a commodity flowing Futuris&apos;s way -- Futuris Auto should avoid too much collateral damage from the closure of Mitsubishi&apos;s Adelaide manufacturing plant.   
Despite the auto business being an incongruous addendum to Futuris&apos;s activity, management seems to have accepted it as a means to smooth earnings in tough rural times.   
But Futuris&apos;s 43 per cent stake in beef producer Australian Agricultural Co remains on the agenda, with a sale expected by June 30.   
AAC posted a cow of an interim result on Thursday, having borne the brunt of rising feed costs and weaker beef prices. AAC should also benefit from rain in that herds can be rebuilt to decent levels.   
Criterion last rated Futuris a hold at $2.67 in May last year, after it rescued the rent-roll consolidator Run Corp with a capital injection. We suggest taking advantage of Futuris&apos;s 14c, 7 per cent fall and buy into the soft commodities boom.   
Apart from weather patterns, another earnings variable is the strength of inflows into the tree-growing subsidiary ITC. So far, ITC has avoided any ill-effects from the confusion surrounding proposed changes to the tax regime covering agricultural managed investments schemes.   
As for AAC, its value lies in its $700 million, 8 million hectare property portfolio, which could be broken up and sold. Nonetheless, AAC&apos;s short-term outlook is lousy and we would avoid the stock, but the wild card is how much Futuris achieves for its stake.

			<TEXT>But the big beef producer still returned a healthy profit    
DROUGHT and the high dollar have bitten into   Australian Agricultural Co&apos;s operations, trimming 64 per cent from the beef producer&apos;s full-year net profit.    
The $3.6 million final result was down from last year&apos;s $10.1 million, which included a tax credit on the sale of a north Queensland cattle station.    
``The business performed pretty well under difficult circumstances,&apos;&apos; said chairman Nick Burton Taylor, who is also acting chief executive following the resignation of Don Mackay last month.    
No resolution is close on the sale of a 43 per cent stake in the company owned by Futuris.    
That was causing ``underlying tension&apos;&apos; for AACo employees, Mr Burton said. An outcome was likely by mid-year.    
The strong investor interest in the stake was encouraging, he said, but he declined to provide details on the bidders&apos; identities.    
AACo&apos;s earnings before interest and tax were up from $22million in 2006 to $31 million in 2007. Shareholders will receive a 9c dividend, including a special 2c dividend as a result of AMP Life&apos;s $10 million settlement last year to terminate litigation over the 2003 Stanbroke Pastoral sell-off.    
A decision on the 2008 dividend would be made ``once seasonal conditions are better known&apos;&apos;, probably around August.    
AACo&apos;s net tangible assets rose 22 per cent in the year, from $2.28 per share to $2.78, and net assets increased 25 per cent in value from $582 million to $726 million.    
Beef production rose 7 per cent from 73 million kilograms to 78 million kilograms, and the calving rate rose from 71 per cent to 74 per cent.    
Operating costs were up 23 per cent, from $169 million to $208 million.    
During the year AACo paid $19 million -- debt funded -- to convert its Goonoo feedlot from leasehold to freehold, which along with interest rate rises and increased herd investment, was responsible for overall borrowing costs rising from $22 million to $30.7 million.    
The size of the company&apos;s cattle herd -- Australia&apos;s biggest -- increased from 556,478 to 588,180 in the year.    
Due to the planned sale of the Futuris stake, AACo&apos;s entire property portfolio was valued for the year, rather than just a proportion as usual.    
The company booked a $203 million boost in the value of property, plant and equipment, up from $586 million to $810 million, reflecting ``the increasing demand for quality northern Australian rural properties&apos;&apos;.    
With most of its stations in northern Australia, AACo had limited exposure to the drought, but its southern Queensland properties ``were in significant drought for the whole year&apos;&apos;, Mr Burton Taylor said.    
The drought&apos;s wider impact was felt through rising feed grain prices and the oversupply of cheap cattle from the south.    
During 2007, AACo increased its wagyu herd by 5000 head, and the company&apos;s wagyu is now being served in 400 restaurants in the US under the Greg Norman Signature Wagyu program.    
AACo also in the past year launched its 1824-brand beef in 85 Woolworths stores in Queensland and the Northern Territory.    
AACo shares closed last night 7 cents lower at $2.98.

			<TEXT>CATTLE giant Australian Agricultural Company (AACo) is prepared to spend &quot;as much as it takes&quot; to have its day in court over missing out on buying competitor Stanbroke Pastoral Company last year.   
At its first annual general meeting in Brisbane since 1994, re-elected chairman Nick Burton Taylor said the company had retained &quot;eminent barristers&quot; to recoup the $2.2 million to $2.5 million in costs it claimed to have incurred as a result of its unsuccessful but higher bid.   
AACo is also suing for unspecified damages relating to the failed transaction.   
AACo claimed it offered AMP, Stanbroke&apos;s then owner, $40 million more than the $490 million winning bid from the Nebo consortium. One of the members of that group, Victorian potato grower Peter Menegazzo, has since bought out the other partners.   
AACo managing director Don Mackay said a directions hearing in the case against AMP -- also AACo&apos;s 11th largest shareholder -- is scheduled for next Friday.   
&quot;AACo is not being emotional or precious about not acquiring Stanbroke. We consider it a serious failure of process and governance that has affected shareholders,&quot; Mr Burton Taylor said.   
However, the ensuing break-up of Stanbroke properties in the past 12 months also led to a massive increase in cattle station land values, with AACo benefiting to the tune of $40 million which contributed to a $22.2 million full-year net profit after tax for 2003-2004.   
Self-generating and regenerating assets (SARGA) were $32.8 million, with net revenue $158.7 million, up 37 per cent on the previous year, with earnings before interest at $41.3 million, an increase of 31 per cent.   
Gross cattle sales were up 53 per cent to reach $148 million, beef sales of its 1824 and Wagyu brands contributed $20.3 million and the disposal of its retail interests in Polkinghornes butchers; Jesters Jaffle Pies, of which it retains 25 per cent; and the Maneroo property contributed $18 million.   
Former CEO Peter Holmes a Court, who last year received close to $1.2 million in remuneration including a $461,000 termination payout for not wanting to move to the newly consolidated headquarters in Brisbane, also sold his remaining shares to about five different institutions.   
New properties bought by AACo including Carrum Station, the Lawn Hill sublease and the Wylarah aggregation near Surat contributed to its 50,000 increase to 468,000 head of cattle, valued at $295.7 million.   
However, increased operating costs are expected due to rising freight costs.   
A shareholder questioned the procurement policies of the company in regard to the dominance of main shareholder Futuris, which owns agricultural products supplier Primac Elders, in its supply of goods to AACo.

			<TEXT>RISING oil prices are costing one of Australia&apos;s largest cattle operators -- the Australian Agricultural Co (AACo) -- an extra $1 million a year in freight expenses.   
AACo chief executive Don Mackay said that in freight costs alone the company spent $8 million a year carrying cattle to market.   
&quot;We also generate our own electricity with diesel -- everything we do requires fuel,&quot; Mr Mackay said.   
Oil prices touched a new all-time high of $US53 in New York overnight, due to tight supply and disruption to output in the Gulf of Mexico as repair work continues on damage from Hurricane Ivan, as well as strikes in Nigeria and Norway.   
Mr Mackay said the extra costs will eventually be passed on to consumers although how much share AACo gets is debatable.   
&quot;We&apos;re at the end of the chain where we don&apos;t always have the opportunity to prescribe it being passed on but it is clearly costing more money,&quot; he said.   
In August, the iconic 180-year-old rural business, which has 22 cattle stations in remote parts of Queensland and the Northern Territory, reported a net profit of $22.22 million for the year to June 30, 2004.   
Shares in AACo closed up 2 to $1.32 yesterday.

			<TEXT>A RECORD beef herd helped the cattle kings of the Australian Agricultural Company (AACo) deliver a 22 per cent jump in full-year net profit to $22.2 million in 2003-04 as the market continued to strengthen.  
The listed rural enterprise boosted its herd by 50,000 to a record closing inventory of 468,000 head while many were downsizing their herds.  
Higher cattle prices worldwide and a $40 million land revaluation underpinned the strength of the Brisbane-based company&apos;s balance sheet and acquisition capacity.  
The company booked a 37 per cent rise in revenue in the 12 months to June 30, 2004, to $158.7 million.  
While the company has exited its high-end Victorian butcher shops and downsized its interest in the West Australian-based Jester Jaffle Pie Company to 25 per cent, revenue was boosted by strong sales of its wholesale wagyu and 1824 branded beef, now sold in 90 restaurants across the east coast.  
Annual beef sales grew 34 per cent to 44.9 million kilograms, up from 33.5 million in the 2003 financial year.  
AACo&apos;s final and total dividend payout for the year was 6 a share, steady on the previous year, and its dividend reinvestment plan has been suspended.  
AACo chief executive officer Don Mackay said it was a good result in a difficult year, particularly after the drought-affected first half that saw the cost of grain used to feed the herd increase significantly.  
He offered guidance to the market that the company was expected to match or even beat its profit this year given the&quot;terrific&quot; start so far in July.  
He said AACo&apos;s balance sheet was primed to continue pursuing acquisitions as and when they occurred.  
&quot;There has been significant growth in the underlying assets of the balance sheet and we have very low gearing at about 31 per cent, so we continue to have opportunities for acquisition.  
&quot;The world demand for beef is continuing to rise and demand outstrips supply.&quot;  
The 180-year-old rural company has doubled in size in the three years since being spun off the West Australian conglomerate Futuris and listing on the stock exchange.  
Its 22 cattle stations in Queensland and Northern Territory cover about 1 per cent of Australia.  
Former chief executive officer Peter Holmes a Court was the first to congratulate Mr Mackay on the result.  
&quot;I feel very good about the outlook and today&apos;s announcement was particularly strong on almost every level, it was really strong,&quot; Mr Holmes a Court said.  
&quot;I remain a supportive shareholder of what management is doing and I think Don is doing a great job.&quot;  
AACo has initiated legal action against AMP over its handling of the sale of AMP&apos;s former subsidiary, Stanbroke Pastoral.  
AACo was the losing bidder when Stanbroke was sold to the rival Nebo consortium for $490 million last September.  
The action remains at the discovery stage in the Federal Court in Sydney.  
AACo maintains it offered AMP $40 million more than the winning Nebo offer for Stanbroke&apos;s 24 stations, plus repaying debt of $72.5 million, but was not the successful bidder. AACo shares closed up 2 at $1.33.

			<TEXT>GOURMET piemaker Shakespeares Pies has taken a bigger share of the Australian market, buying West Australian-based Jesters Jaffle Pies Co Pty Ltd.  
The deal means Shakespeares will operate 61 gourmet pie shops across Australia and NZ, making it the country&apos;s largest franchise pie business.  
Jesters is being sold by cattle-breeding operation Australian Agricultural Company, which will take a 25 per cent stake in Shakespeares and gain board representation as part of the deal.  
Shakespeares chairman Neil Whittaker said the acquisition, the price of which has not been disclosed, was an exciting development which would benefit franchisees and their customers.  
&quot;We are delighted to have Jesters as part of the Shakespeares family and this purchase is a major step in our expansion program,&quot; he said. &quot;Shakespeares and Jesters have much to offer each other and franchisees will benefit from the strength and security of being in a larger organisation, which has a strong management focused on developing premium consumer food brands.&quot;  
Majority owned by investment company Hunter Bay Partners, Shakespeares has 15 NSW stores, with the number set to jump to 30 in the next 12 months.  
It was established in 1994 when Anthony Gualdi and his wife Beth opened the first store in Manly.  
The business teamed up with Hunter in 2003, opening seven outlets in the 2003-04 financial year.  
Jesters has 34 shops in Western Australia, along with eight in Victoria and four in NZ.  
The company was set up in 1997 by Richard Anderson, with the first shop opening in Claremont in Perth. It moved into the Melbourne market in 2003.  
The transaction is hoped to be completed by 31 July 2004.

			<TEXT>&apos;What we are offering is the chance for investors to tap into Australia&apos;s globally competitive beef cattle industry&apos;  
INVESTORS will get the chance to be a part of the Australian beef industry under a new managed investment scheme that expects to provide subscribers with deductible tax losses for five years.  
The project is being brought to market by agricultural investment specialist Environinvest Ltd, chaired by Roger Pescott, and Rural Management Partners, a subsidiary of the listed beef cattle giant the Australian Agricultural Company (AACo).  
The fund will be limited to a capital raising of about $5.5 million.  
The project will start with a substantial herd of 12,500 growing to an estimated 50,000 head over the life of the MIS, agisted across 130,000ha of leased land in NSW and Queensland.  
Subscribers will buy units or droves with each drove containing four females.  
The minimum application requires the investor to take 10 droves at a cost of $17,500 with the price for subsequent droves set at $1750 each.  
Under the scheme, investors will lease the four females in each initial drove and own the subsequent progeny and the offspring of the progeny.  
Investors will earn revenue through the sale of steers, cull cows and cull heifers throughout the life of the project and at the end of the project when the entire herd is sold off.  
Investors will have to carry additional costs including a range of fees for leasing, management and agistment as well as feedlot, the cost of sales, transportation and a performance bonus.  
They will also have to pay any taxes, levies, charges or duty not anticipated by the project.  
Environinvest can also &quot;recover out-of-pocket expenses for abnormal events&quot;.  
The company believes it is unlikely that revenue streams will exceed fees and expenses until at least the fifth year.  
&quot;Over the life of the project net taxable profits are forecast,&quot; the product disclosure statement says.  
&quot;However, in years one to five allowable deductions are expected to exceed taxable income resulting in a tax loss that should be able to be deducted against other income.&quot;  
Environinvest said it had all of the obligatory product rulings from the Australian Taxation Office, it had attracted a multiple star rating from independent investment assessor Adviser Edge and Lonsdale Securities had rated it as recommended.  
&quot;What we are offering is the chance for investors to tap into Australia&apos;s globally competitive beef cattle industry, without having to overcome the traditional hurdle of a large capital requirement,&quot; Mr Pescott said.  
By not carrying the cost of land holdings on its balance sheet, the scheme was structured to provide higher returns and achieve economies of scale.  
&quot;The scheme, which will run for seven years, has an estimated after-tax return of 14 per cent with return on investment beginning after two years and annually thereafter,&quot; he said.

			<TEXT>DROUGHT and fluctuating cattle prices have forced the Australian Agricultural Company to revise its full-year profit on the back of steady three-quarter numbers.   
The country&apos;s largest cattle producer revealed that, for the nine months to March 31, earnings before interest and tax tumbled to $13 million -- down $8.1 million on the previous corresponding period.   
Revenue for the period rose $10.7 million to $84 million and the company blamed three one-off expenditures for battering the earnings figures.   
AACo chief executive Don Mackay said $3.9 million was expensed through the Stanbroke Pastoral Company tender which cost $2.5 million, exit of the Polkinghornes butchery business and relocation of its head office to Brisbane.   
In its numbers, AACo revealed beef sales came in at 28.4 million kilograms compared with 24.3 million in the previous corresponding period.   
Despite the output increase the company revised its full-year net profit growth guidance from a 15 to 25 per cent range, to just 15 per cent.   
Mr Mackay said the drought and changing SGARA (self generating and regenerating assets) cattle price movements were responsible for the downgrade. The company last year made an $18.3 million net profit.   
&quot;15 per cent is at the lower end of the range of where we previously said,&quot; Mr Mackay said.   
&quot;Our profit is very heavily reliant on the movements in the cattle price.   
&quot;If the market moves 5 to 10 per cent up or down then our profit is substantially impacted.&quot;   
AACo is Australia&apos;s largest cattle producer with 460,000 head of cattle but looks likely to lose that title with the complete buyout of the Stanbroke Pastoral Company by Peter Menegazzo.   
It also announced yesterday it would no longer pay an interim dividend and revert to its previous policy of just one final dividend.   
Mr Mackay said one dividend was in line with AACo&apos;s cash flow cycle and the company expected this full year&apos;s to be similar to the 6 paid last year.   
A Sydney-based analyst, who did not want to be named, said AACo&apos;s numbers appeared solid and in line with most expectations.   
The profit revision, he said, was not surprising given the current dry conditions which could have had a more severe impact on AACo&apos;s bottom line.   
&quot;Some of their assets are in north Queensland which is less in drought then other areas,&quot; he said.   
&quot;It has tried to lessen its exposure to the weather conditions by going into feedlots.   
&quot;`However, it is still being affected with feed costs which go up when it&apos;s drier.&quot;

			<TEXT>BEEF exporter Australian Agricultural Company will fork out almost $25 million on the purchase of six adjoining properties in southeast Queensland.   
The properties are near Surat and will be used for the backgrounding -- the grass feeding before entry into a feedlot -- of about 26,000 cattle a year.   
&quot;The availability of water and ability to produce grain and forage crops enable 365-days-a-year cattle flow to the feedlot,&quot; said AACo chief executive Don Mackay.   
The acquisitions follow expenditure of $50 million for the purchase of 58,000 cattle and other property additions earlier this year, which have been funded by a term debt facility. AACo said the costs would be partially offset by the auction in May of the company&apos;s Maneroo aggregation, which includes the property Corona.   
AACo now runs more than 460,000 cattle.   
AACo shares closed 1 lower yesterday at $1.13.

			<TEXT>&apos;The office has become as much a part of life as the home&apos;  
Daniel Petre  
Author, Father Time  
THE decision by businessman Peter Holmes a Court to leave Australia&apos;s oldest company and second biggest cattle producer, Australian Agricultural Co Ltd, for family reasons is significant. As chief executive, Holmes a Court was not prepared to relocate to AACo&apos;s new head office in Brisbane and remove his young family from their Sydney home.  
By deciding to put the welfare of his wife and their two sets of young twins, 4 1/2-year-old boys and 10-week-old girls, first, Holmes a Court has bucked a trend in Australian corporate life of work being all.  
For many men, if they indicate a desire to downshift work commitments, then it may be taken as a pointer as to how serious you are about a career. Holmes a Court will remain a non-executive director of AACo, but he has clearly declared his priorities.  
What Holmes a Court faced is what many men, and not just at executive level, also struggle to manage. This is a balance between family life and work expectations. They may want to change, but for financial reasons they are trapped in the ever-tightening cycle of work demands and inadequate time with their families.  
Holmes a Court is lucky -- he has the financial flexibility to make such a decision work for him. Many other men find that while the desire to change their working patterns is there, reality necessitates something altogether different.  
Daniel Petre is former managing director of Microsoft Australia, and subsequently a vice-president at Microsoft&apos;s corporate headquarters in Seattle, US. Petre resigned from Microsoft in 1996.  
He decided to change his life and put family ahead of software.  
Two years later he wrote Father Time, which explored the need for men to re-order work and family. Petre summarises the lot of many men in these terms: &quot;The office has become as much a part of life as the home. In many instances the office now defines family life well beyond the impact of the wages earned to support the family.  
&quot;Men&apos;s definition of themselves is often determined by their work and career. For many executive men work has become the way they want to be seen and be recognised.&quot;  
The negative consequences of men working longer hours are clear: less time and opportunity to be part of a family and related stresses on their physical wellbeing.  
Most men need to work to support themselves and their families. So there is no real point in criticising work.  
However, what should be emphasised is this: where work arrangements display a level of flexibility which enables employees to balance work and family, the benefits are immediate.  
In a survey by the Business Council of Australia of 68 of Australia&apos;s biggest companies in October last year, it was found that that those who introduced family-friendly strategies reaped rewards, with employees more satisfied.  
Their satisfaction stemmed from being happier with the work/family juggle. Men need help here from their employers.  
As federal Labor Member for Sydney Tanya Pilbersek pointed out recently: &quot;For men to pull their weight at home we need workplaces that recognise that it&apos;s not fair or efficient to have people working until 8 every night.&quot;  
In a joint study undertaken in 1998 by Macquarie University and the University of Western Australia in attitudes to balancing work and family, 10 per cent of female respondents said they felt they had compromised child rearing and family life for their jobs and careers -- interestingly this compared with 20 per cent of men who felt the same way.  
Findings by Adrienne Burgess, recently in Australia, of the Institute of Public Policy research in Britain, show that three out of four men believed that their family relationships had been damaged by their working lives.  
Still, as Barbara Pocock pointed out in The Work/Life Collision, her important study last year into work and family, men who take the Holmes a Court option may make a fatal career move.  
Sure, they may keep a job, but it will not generally lead to higher things. The reason is palpably clear. Families are excess baggage on the corporate trail.  
Pocock puts it this way: &quot;Men who refuse extra hours, try to restrict their working week, ask to work part-time or refuse promotion to avoid long hours find themselves viewed with suspicion. Some feel they are not viewed as serious about their work and thus in danger of disappearing down the daddy track. A limited time commitment or a desire to work part-time are read as bad signs.&quot;  
Sadly, even though there is this desire by many men to work less, the fact is Australians are working longer. The average working hours of full-time employees grew by 3.1 hours between 1982 and 2001.  
The consequences of this on family life are considerable. In an ACTU study undertaken in 1999 it was found, so Pocock records, &quot;broad intensification across a wide range of workplaces creates patterns of dysfunctional behaviour in workers&apos; personal lives, which affect the quality of their interactions with their family and friends&quot;.  
Can we go on like this? Do men want to go on like this? The answer in both cases is no.  
Do we need more top-level role models such as Holmes a Court who put family before career? Yes.  
Until we have a workplace environment where fathers are considered just as important to family life as mothers, we will have a culture of absent dads and children who miss them. Is any career worth that?

			<TEXT>A MOVE by the country&apos;s second largest cattle producer Australian Agricultural Co Ltd to headquarter itself in Brisbane should be seen as a positive, a leading analyst said yesterday.   
The 180-year-old company took the market by surprise on Friday when it announced the resignation of chief executive officer Peter Holmes a Court and a move of its headquarters from Sydney to Brisbane.   
Mr Holmes a Court will remain as a director on the board but will be replaced as CEO by former executive director of operations Don Mackay, who is already based in Brisbane.   
AACo&apos;s stock shed 3, or 2.4 per cent, to close at $1.24 yesterday as the market registered its first reaction to the move.   
Charlie Green, director of Queensland specialist broker Hunter Green, said the move should be seen as a positive, with Mr Mackay &quot;highly regarded&quot; by institutions. &quot;I think having a head office in Brisbane, closer to the operations, has got to be a good thing,&quot; Mr Green said.   
&quot;And they have just bought (Carrum Station) a week ago, that will require some pretty intensive management and being in Queensland makes a lot of sense.   
&quot;So if you can get a management team in there to really work those assets and to point up the cash flow, it really can have some quite good upside.&quot;   
But Mr Green warned there might be some concern over a perceived overhang in relation to Mr Holmes a Court&apos;s continuing shareholding. A major shareholder in AACo with almost 8 per cent of stock, Mr Holmes a Court, who decided not to move his young family from Sydney, yesterday stressed he had &quot;absolutely no intention&quot; of selling his shares.   
&quot;I feel very confident about the place that the Australian cattle industry and AACo specifically is in right now and I have absolutely no intention of selling my shares,&quot; he said. &quot;It is a good dividend stock with secure assets. I have liked being an investor, I am very welcome being an investor and will continue to be an investor.&quot;   
AACo has 19 cattle stations in Queensland and the Northern Territory covering some 6.5 million hectares.   
Mr Holmes a Court denied speculation his failure to purchase the country&apos;s largest cattle company, Stanbroke Pastoral Co, from AMP Life last year had led to a souring of his relationship with the board.   
AACo remains locked in a legal battle with AMP Life over the sale of Stanbroke to Nebo Holdings, a consortium of growers and investors.   
Mr Mackay, who took over the reins as of yesterday, said the move would not bring much change to the company.   
&quot;I have been since the beginning part of the team that took the business public,&quot; he said. &quot;My view will always be slightly different (from Mr Holmes a Court).&quot;

			<TEXT>PETER Holmes a Court, who sold out of his family business to build his own corporate life, shocked the market yesterday by resigning as chief executive of the 180-year-old Australian Agricultural Company, which he brought back to the stock exchange lists in 2001.   
The resignation came as AACo, Australia&apos;s second biggest cattle operation, decided to close its Sydney head office and shift its HQ to Brisbane.   
Mr Holmes a Court will be succeeded by AACo&apos;s executive director of operations Don Mackay.   
AACo said yesterday its board had decided to move all corporate functions to Brisbane, and Mr Holmes a Court had declined to relocate.   
AACo earlier this week splashed out $50 million to increase its land holdings and cattle numbers, buying Carrum Station at Julia Creek and striking an agistment deal over Lawn Hill Station in the Gulf.   
AACo chairman Nick Burton Taylor said: &quot;Our operations are all in Queensland now and we want the management team in one place.   
&quot;Peter faced a very difficult decision and has spent a lot of time talking it over at Christmas time with his family,&quot;   
Mr Holmes a Court will remain a non-executive director of the 180-year-old business, in which he holds a 7.5 per cent stake. He said he did not want to uproot his young family from Sydney, where they have lived since returning from the US in 2000.   
&quot;We just moved to Australia three-and-a-half years ago to take up this job. I&apos;m not ready to move on. I like Sydney and I&apos;ll look for another opportunity as good as the last one.&quot;   
Mr Holmes a Court insisted he was not sorry to be stepping down. &quot;No, I leave the company in a really strong position,&quot; he said.   
&quot;Since joining in 2000, we have weathered an extensive drought while returning shareholders an above market return and grown to be the largest breeding herd in Australia.   
&quot;We&apos;ve achieved everything we set out to do when we went public and we leave the company poised to take advantage of what&apos;s gone on in north Asia.&quot;   
Mr Holmes a Court joined AACo ahead of its relisting on the stock exchange by Futuris Corporation -- the Perth-based conglomerate run by Alan Newman, who was second in command to Peter&apos;s father Robert, when Holmes a Court senior made the name a household word by almost succeeding in a bid for BHP.   
While Mr Holmes a Court had said in the past that he was keen to step back from being the only public face of the company, it will all but inevitably be assumed that his departure is not simply a lifestyle choice, but due to a falling out -- either with AACo&apos;s board or Futuris.   
AACo failed last year to win Stanbroke Pastoral Company -- Australia&apos;s biggest pastoralist -- which was auctioned off by AMP.   
And a legal attempt to stop the sale to a consortium, Nebo Holdings, which included burger king Jack Cowin, was panned in court.   
Mr Holmes a Court returned to Australia, after almost a decade in the US, and sold out of the family company, Heytesbury Holdings led by his mother Janet and managed by his brother Paul.   
He said his next step was to take a holiday with wife Divonne and their two sets of twins -- four-and-a-half-year-old boys and girls aged 10 weeks.   
&quot;I&apos;ll take a few weeks off with my family, and look for the next opportunity,&quot; he said.

			<TEXT>THE thwarted under-bidder for Stanbroke Pastoral Company is understood to be watching from the sidelines for any opportunities arising from an ownership rift.   
A source close to Australian Agricultural Company indicated that if the reported rift between shareholders of Nebo Holdings resulted in Stanbroke being broken up, AACo would certainly be a buyer. Reports this week suggested that 25 per cent shareholder Jack Cowin could sell his stake as a result of disharmony among the Nebo consortium.   
Peter Holmes a Court&apos;s AACo unsuccessfully tried to block the $490 million sale of Stanbroke to Nebo Holdings last year, claiming it offered a higher price.   
Since AMP Life sold off Stanbroke as a going concern, Nebo, a consortium of Australian families and Mr Cowin, has sold three of the four properties it opted to sell from Stanbroke&apos;s 27-property portfolio.   
Rural property sources said it was &quot;no surprise&quot; to hear of disharmony among the diverse interests who own Stanbroke. They include 50 per cent owner and chairman Peter Menegazzo, a potato farmer from Swan Hill in Victoria and four Queensland grazing families including long-term Stanbroke director and central Queensland cattleman Peter Hughes.   
Neither returned calls this week. Stanbroke chief executive John Cox said yesterday he had not received any calls from the owners of Stanbroke since the media reports were published.   
&quot;It is a Nebo issue, an owner&apos;s issue and has nothing to do with Stanbroke management,&quot; Mr Cox said.   
&quot;As professional managers we&apos;re just getting on with business and leaving speculation to the speculators, as we&apos;ve been doing for 40 years.&quot;   
Stanbroke includes 24 working cattle properties in Queensland and the Northern Teritory, downstream processing businesses, 600-plus staff and Australia&apos;s largest herd of cattle (about 450,000 head) under one owner.

			<TEXT>THE man who heads the largest pastoral company in the country, Don Mackay of the Australian Agricultural Co, warns that Japan&apos;s decision to allow US exports back into the country would prove a challenge for the industry next year.   
Mr Mackay said the market had already experienced a modest correction but the full effect of the impending Japanese decision had not been felt.   
&quot;I think we have had some preparatory downtown already as a result of it but very few people have a knowledge of how much volume is likely to be shipped,&quot; he said.   
Mr Mackay anticipated initial shipments would be reasonably low but that we would witness a slight downturn in the first quarter of next year before the market rebounded.   
He agreed that times were good but that better returns had been experienced by the country&apos;s major pastoral companies in previous years.   
The AACo chief said the real positive was that the industry had achieved similar nominal levels two years ago but the Australian dollar had appreciated 30 per cent since.   
He said a key issue which would underpin the industry moving forward was Australia&apos;s leading technology and ability to now track and identify cattle from anywhere in the country.   
AACo is one of the oldest companies in Australia.   
It operates 26 stations and two feedlots on 7.9 million ha, or about 1 per cent of Australia&apos;s land mass and running 524,000 beef cattle.

			<TEXT>DEMAND for branded beef is expected to drive Brisbane-based beef producer Australian Agricultural Co to a strong second-half performance as seasonal conditions stabilise and cattle prices remain high.  
The cattle giant yesterday reported a $6.7 million first-half profit after tax for the June 30 half year with a continuing rise in global demand for beef expected to maintain its bottom line.  
Revenue in its wholesale beef business, which includes the 1824 brand, wagyu distribution and 45 per cent stake in food service distributor Chef&apos;s Partner, grew by 24 per cent in the 12 months to June 2005 with EBIT in the segment up by 35.8 per cent in the same period.  
Escalating fuel costs added $1 million to costs in the past year and are expected to cost a similar amount in the next 12 months.  
But costs are expected to be contained in its grain consumption with some stations buying forward grain for up until December 2006.  
&quot;We&apos;ve had a good year with strong cattle markets and much improved cash flow,&quot; managing director Don Mackay said.  
&quot;Our wagyu markets are particularly strong.&quot;  
Concerns about the United States&apos; re-entry into the Japanese and Korean markets after disease scares were unlikely to hurt the group which had a strong presence in north Asian supermarket shelves, Mr Mackay said.  
But Canada, which is emerging from its own BSE outbreak three years ago, is likely to keep Australian beef exporters on its toes.  
&quot;They&apos;re setting themselves up with things like traceability (of animals) and they will be a major threat no doubt,&quot; he said.  
&quot;Brazil is the gorilla in this whole deal.  
&quot;They have more cattle than Australia, the United States and Canada put together but they have big domestic consumption.&quot;  
ABN Amro Morgans analyst Belinda Moore has not changed her forecast of a $27 million full-year profit.  
Group revenue rose 7 per cent to $85.6 million and it will pay a dividend of 7 a share.  
AACo shares closed up 1.5 yesterday at $1.78.

			<TEXT>CATTLE property investments are offering better returns than residential or commercial land, a new index has shown.   
The Australian Grazing Property Index (AGPI) released yesterday found over the last 25 years, cattle grazing land achieved 16 per cent per annum capital gain, outperforming residential property at 13.2 per cent and commercial property at 8.5 per cent.   
But while the sell-off of former cattle giant Stanbroke Pastoral Company&apos;s properties in the last two years had created a strong market on top of good cattle prices, the overall AGPI fell by 8 per cent in 2004 compared with 2003.   
And higher quality smaller properties are not even being listed on the market as they are owned by family companies.   
The AGPI was put together by Australian Agricultural Company subsidiary Rural Management Partners (RMP) and Brisbane-based property valuers Herron Todd White to create a benchmark to rate agricultural investments, RMP business development manager Anne Maree Weston said.   
&quot;Despite the apparent appetite for investment in agriculture there&apos;s a lack of understanding and a lack of credible benchmarks to rate agricultural investments,&quot; Ms Weston said.   
&quot;There are negative perceptions to do with climate, drought and the volatility of the industry and institutional investors don&apos;t have knowledge of the returns.&quot;   
Properties larger than 40,000ha have been the big achievers because of the economies of large-scale production, with sale prices up by 77 per cent not including the Stanbroke properties.   
The smaller properties on the market tended to be lower quality but overall sale prices were expected to grow on the strength of current cattle prices, Ms Weston said.   
Average sale prices for properties in the 10,000 to 40,000ha category were 10.9 per cent lower in 2004 than 2003 prices while average sales prices in the 2000 to 40,000ha group fell by 0.6 per cent.   
RMP said climate change was one of the major hurdles for beef producers with major production areas likely to move northwards to areas with more consistent rainfall.   
The index will be released quarterly.

			<TEXT>BUOYED by a recent dump of rain in Queensland, cattle giant Australian Agricultural Company says it is confident of paying a dividend again this year.  
AACo managing director Don Mackay said its Wylarah station in Queensland -- one of AACo&apos;s two properties affected by the drought -- received 80 to 100 millimetres of rain in the past week.  
&quot;We&apos;ll benefit greatly from that,&quot; Mr Mackay said. &quot;That rainfall event in central and southern Queensland is very valuable.&quot;  
Only two of AACo&apos;s 25 properties in Qld and the Northern Territory have been affected by the drought.  
AACo, which delivered a 6 dividend in October 2004, is expected to make another offering to investors this year.  
&quot;We believe we&apos;ll have a good, strong cash flow year that would support our capacity to pay dividend,&quot; Mr Mackay said.  
Despite the season being below average and store cattle prices falling, there had been some positives for the company.  
&quot;Prices of prime cattle are pretty good, and in fact in the last week or two they&apos;ve started to restrengthen again,&quot; he said.  
&quot;The recent rain in Queensland will take some pressure off (store cattle prices) and if there&apos;s further good rains that fall in southern Australia, that pressure will come off even more and you will see prices for those cattle start to rise again.&quot;  
Australia&apos;s largest pastoral company booked a $6.18 million net profit for the six months to December 2004, compared with a $2.86 million loss in the previous corresponding period.  
Mr Mackay blamed the fall in the company&apos;s share price this year on misconceptions about the re-entry of US beef and the current drought in southern Australia.  
&quot;The majority of our stations never get rain this time of year,&quot; he said.  
&quot;I think that&apos;s one of the misconceptions, that people in southern Australia are sitting out expectantly looking over the horizon for rain because they need it.  
&quot;It&apos;s their time of year to get it. (But in) the majority of our stations it&apos;s not going to rain, you can wait forever and it will never rain in June or July in Darwin because it doesn&apos;t.  
&quot;The season, as it affects us, I think is not properly understood.&quot;  
Mr Mackay also said the company did not have concerns about the possibility of the US re-entering the beef export market in 2005.  
After the discovery of BSE (mad cow disease) in December 2003, US beef exports were banned in Japan and Korea, although they are expected to resume later this year.  
&quot;The protocols that have been developed between the US and Japan for re-entry of that product into that market . . . it would take, in my view, some time for them to adapt their systems to have any volume in that market,&quot; he said.  
&quot;In any event, the US is in a deficit position in terms of beef produced, beef consumed, and they are importing beef today.&quot;  
AACo shares fell half a cent to $1.37 yesterday.

			<TEXT>GRAIN handler and marketer GrainCorp has become the latest agribusiness to fall victim to the weather as its forecast profit dried up under the sun.   
Shares in GrainCorp and other agricultural stocks yesterday fell sharply after GrainCorp downgraded its profit forecast for fiscal 2005 to between $10 million and $12 million, compared to earlier forecasts of $14 million to $16 million.   
GrainCorp shares slumped $1.10 or 8.7 per cent to $11.50.   
Other agricultural stocks also suffered. Barley producer ABB Grain fell 33 or 5.8 per cent to $5.35 and beef producer Australian Agricultural Co (AACo) dropped 9 or 6.2 per cent to $1.36.   
Agricultural services provider Futuris Corp was 10 or 5.4 per cent lower at $1.75, and wheat exporter AWB was off 4 at $4.16.   
GrainCorp managing director Tom Keene said the group&apos;s profit forecast had been mainly affected by disappointing grain receivals for the 2004-05 harvest of 9.5 million tonnes -- 500,000 tonnes short of earlier forecasts.   
&quot;Whilst the summer crop harvest is still under way, the continued dry conditions have clearly impacted on receivals,&quot; he said.   
GrainCorp said the dry summer and autumn meant summer crop grain receivals had fallen short of expectations and exports had been subdued as grain is retained by the local market for potential domestic consumption.   
GrainCorp, which is expected to report its half-year results on May 26, booked a $25.7 million net profit for 2003-04.   
Lonsec Agribusiness Research managing director Norman Graham said agricultural stocks were suffering as the weather bureau started to talk about an El Nino effect taking hold and the market started to focus on that.   
&quot;At the moment people are getting a bit negative, saying it&apos;s getting further into the season, there&apos;s mixed signals coming out of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the market sentiment towards anything is shocking, so any excuse and let&apos;s get rid of it,&quot; Mr Graham said.   
he said stocks such as AWB, GrainCorp, ABB Grain, AACo and Futuris had suffered significant falls over the last two months.   
Agricultural stocks in general had underperformed in comparison to small-cap stocks by around 10 per cent.   
&quot;That 10 per cent underperformance is probably due to meteorological circumstances,&quot; Mr Graham said.   
Agricultural stocks would only pick up &quot;when it rains&quot;.   
&quot;If it rains in the next two to three weeks, it&apos;s not too late to still get a decent crop and these things (stocks) can rebound very quickly because they are going to be cheap.&quot;   
Meanwhile, wheat exporter AWB said in a presentation to a Macquarie Securities conference yesterday that it expected earnings in 2004-05 &quot;comparable&quot; to the previous year.   
In February, ABB Grain said it expected an annual net profit before goodwill amortisation of $35 million to $37 million.

			<TEXT>LOW rainfall and the re-entry of US beef into the lucrative Japanese market are not expected to affect production figures for Brisbane-based cattle producer Australian Agricultural Company.  
AACo yesterday told the Australian Stock Exchange that while the season was &quot;below average&quot; because of lower than expected rainfall, only two of its 25 properties in Queensland and the Northern Territory were affected by drought.  
A spokesman said the company had diversified the geographical location of properties through recent pastoral acquisitions including the Victoria River group in the NT for $80 million earlier this year.  
The two drought affected properties were near Roma and in the western Queensland channel country and the company currently was negotiating for a smaller station in the Gulf of Carpentaria.  
In February, AACO reported a $6.19 million six month profit after a $2.9 million loss in the previous corresponding period. It currently is running more than 510,000 head of cattle.  
Yesterday it also revealed 26 Coles supermarkets in Queensland were stocking its premium grade 1824 branded beef following a successful trial in 10 outlets.  
The spokesman expected the number of Coles outlets selling 1824 to increase over the year but was unable to confirm the value to the group.  
The statement also said if Japanese and Korean markets were again opened to US beef, it was unlikely the Americans would have enough supply in the early stages.  
AACo shares defied the bloodletting on the local market yesterday to close 3 stronger at $1.56.

			<TEXT>It&apos;s more than twice the size of Luxembourg and you can all but have it to yourself. Donna Coutts visits Wrotham Park Station in Queensland&apos;s Outback  
THERE is debate among the four guests as to which countries are smaller than Wrotham Park.  
It&apos;s not that we lack the technology to look on the Internet. It&apos;s just that the leather lounges are too comfortable, the gin and tonic plentiful and the air too cool in the bar for any of us to tear ourselves away.  
It&apos;s an abstract concept, anyway. Apart from 14 resort staff tending to every whim, plus 23 station staff, we four guests have this outback Queensland cattle station to ourselves.  
And it&apos;s not as though we can see any of the boundary fences. So how big? In the Australian Agricultural Company&apos;s pastoral empire -- which accounts for about 1 per cent of Australia -- it&apos;s a modest patch of dirt.  
But it covers 600,000ha -- by comparison, Luxembourg is only 258,600ha, Singapore 62,000ha.  
Wrotham Park is midway between Cairns and the Gulf of Carpentaria, on grazing land technically called gulf savannah.  
AACo runs about 35,000 brahman cattle here, most of them eventually bound for markets in the Middle East.  
We&apos;re here because the station is now open as a resort, a joint venture between AACo, the R.M. Williams company and Voyages Resorts, which also manages Cradle Mountain Lodge in Tasmania and Silky Oaks and Brampton Island in Queensland.  
The Wrotham resort is an ultra-luxurious oasis for a maximum of 20 guests. It opened last September for a couple of months before the Wet and though many of the first guests were north Queenslanders checking out their own back yard, it&apos;s likely most future guests will be from much farther away, where there&apos;s more novelty in the vast, open spaces, the cattle, the Outback lifestyle and the heat.  
If you have not been to this part of the country, don&apos;t picture Central Australian desert, western New South Wales barrenness or north Queensland tropicana.  
The dirt is red but the landscape is gently undulating, crisscrossed with big rivers, lightly wooded and covered in shrubs and grasses.  
A stay at the resort is a cleverly orchestrated Outback experience, with station life on show, but guests are insulated from discomfort with airconditioning, plentiful fine food and wine and tasteful interior design.  
The cabins, or quarters, as they&apos;re called, are well spaced and metres from the edge of the cliff that forms the bank of the Mitchell River.  
Apart from sleeping and the time you choose to spend chilling out on your quarters&apos; private veranda, it&apos;s the resort homestead that is the focus.  
So how to fill a stay with more than cold drinks and airconditioned comfort?  
With ease. We take a guided nature walk, slowly, when the heat has gone from the day. From the homestead, we clamber down the cliff face into the gorge and see stunning earth formations, birds, wallabies, lizards and butterflies.  
There&apos;s also a freshwater crocodile snooping about in the water a metre or so from where we stand.  
Then there is a station tour in new LandCruisers. We drive for eight hours and still see only a tiny corner of Wrotham. But we do see pairs of majestic sarus cranes that stand as tall as the couple of emus we pass sheltering beneath a tree laden with the nests of bird-eating barking spiders.  
The dozens of wedge-tailed eagles cruising above us are almost as big as the cranes. At a pretty, spring-fed waterhole covered in lilies we disturb a huge flock of magpie geese. The squawking is deafening.  
We also see the real business of the station: massive herds of brahman cattle grazing and standing about in the shade, their pendulous flaps of skin swaying in the breeze, helping to keep them cool.  
In the stockyards close to the homestead the calves are being weaned from the cows. The dust there is thick and the brahmans&apos; floppy bits slap about as they run.  
On the lawn of the homestead, at the station proper, we have a picnic lunch: baguettes stuffed with ham and brie followed by giant, cold mangoes picked from the tree above us.  
On the weekend of our visit station hands erect the above-ground pool they have bought with funds raised through their social club. Sure, it may take a couple of wet seasons to fill, but a swim after a day spent mustering on horseback is worth waiting for.  
Back at the resort, the designer lap pool is always full, though populated each morning with cane toads that have to be fished out as part of the morning chores. But there are 14 staff to see to that.  
Donna Coutts was a guest of Voyages Resorts.  
THINGS TO DO  
Activities include station tours, canoeing, fishing, nature walks, mountain biking, horse riding and cooking demonstrations.  
The menu changes daily and is prepared by a chef using mainly north Queensland produce, including fresh seafood flown in. Dishes are a mixture of modern and traditional country cooking. There is a bar and wine cellar.

			<TEXT>BEEF producer Australian Agricultural Company is expected to launch a $67 million capital raising through a one-for-five entitlements offer to its shareholders.  
AACo asked the Australian Stock Exchange to suspend trading in its securities yesterday and is expected to make a statement about the capital raising today.  
ABN Amro is completing the capital raising for AACo, with the offer to be made to existing shareholders. The entitlements offer, which equates to about 18 per cent of AACo&apos;s market capitalisation, is to be pegged at a discount to its last closing price of $1.87.  
AACo would not comment yesterday.  
Market sources expect the funds raised will be applied to reduce debt.  
AACo reported a $6.19 million profit for the December 31 half year.

			<TEXT>STRONG global demand for beef and new pastoral acquisitions has driven Brisbane-based Australian Agricultural Co to a $6.19 million six-month profit after reporting a $2.9 million loss in the previous corresponding period.  
But it warned the Australian dollar staying in the US74 to US78 range was the key to meeting its 2005 budget.  
Reporting its six-month figures yesterday after moving its reporting date from the financial to the calendar year, AACo chairman Nick Burton Taylor said the relocation of its head office to Brisbane last year had contributed to the result.  
Mr Burton Taylor said the consolidation of the executive team in Brisbane -- former CEO Peter Holmes a Court was based in Sydney -- had &quot;delivered improved communication, cost savings and concentration of effort&quot;.  
The company reported a $31.3 million net profit for the Dcember 31 year, up $19.7 million on 2003 with a record number of 524,000 head of cattle.  
Mr Burton Taylor signalled at the annual general meeting last year the 184-year-old company was on the lookout for new properties, buying Carrum Station, the Lawn Hill sublease and the Wylarah aggregation near Surat in 2003-04.  
Its major acquisition since the AGM was the $80 million Victoria River Group in the Northern Territory.  
Managing director Don Mackay said good returns from production because of shortage of supply meant good large-scale properties had appreciated in value.  
&quot;At June 2004 AACo booked a valuation increment of $40.7 million and at December 2004 a further $53.7 million has been booked,&quot; Mr Mackay said. &quot;Ongoing sustainable development of the company&apos;s high quality properties has been recognised in the market place in the form of increased values.&quot;  
Besides movement in the Australian dollar, the company&apos;s 2005 result is also under threat from the return of Canadian and US beef to key Asian markets after disease bans are removed this year.  
AACo shares yesterday closed down 5 at $2.63.  
AACo is believed to be preparing for court action to recoup the $2.2 million to $2.5 million in costs it claimed to have incurred as a result of its unsuccessful but higher bid for Stanbroke Pastoral Company in 2003.

			<TEXT>BUDDING Queen St cattle barons don&apos;t have to set foot in a paddock or saleyard to start their herd.  
They can now trade next year&apos;s T-bone the way they trade shares in BHP or Rio Tinto -- on the Internet.  
Modern technology like the Internet and microchips means cattle owners don&apos;t have to go near a rural property. They can buy, sell -- and in the future potentially see their investments mustered -- online.  
Roma&apos;s Tim Scott and Charlie Frith came up with the idea for Beef Stock Market after Mr Frith, a well-known grazier, thought individuals would be interested in owning cattle.  
While there are other similar managed investment schemes available like Australian Agricultural Company subsidiary Rural Management Partners&apos; Environinvest, and investors can always buy shares in cattle companies, Mr Scott said the difference with BSM was that city slickers could own individual cattle and keep track of them by using RFID (radio frequency identification devices) technology.  
And the scheme has proved a cash cow for investors with returns in the 20 per cent range.  
The business partners believed making investors feel a part of the cattle industry was their market niche, with some visiting their investments where they were agisted and even attending cattle sales.  
And with things looking up in the Australian cattle industry as prices remain high after the drought and exports in particular expected to perform well, the pair have attracted a number of investors.  
Continued Page 32  
Online herds prove to be a lucrative cash cow  
From Page 27  
The BSM website says that &quot;you buy the stock, we fatten them for you and, if you wish, we sell them on your behalf&quot;.  
Investors decide how much they want to put in (one animal costs about $500). They are then assigned the corresponding number of cattle based on the weight and price set by the Queensland Cattle Market at the Roma Saleyards.  
The animals are individually marked with microchips in the new electronic National Livestock Identification Scheme so investors are recognised as the animal&apos;s owner. Investors receive weight gain information and market and climate reports to help decide when to sell; or they can elect a livestock manager.  
The investment is for about eight months while the cattle reach a weight where they can be sold, usually in feedlots.  
A risk to investors is that Queensland Cattle Market prices will fall but the industry currently is very buoyant as producers restock after the drought and exports continue to perform well.  
Investor Gordon McWilliam said two lots of $10,000 investments had provided returns of 23 per cent over six months and 11 per cent over seven months.  
&quot;Shares weren&apos;t doing a lot and I can&apos;t afford property,&quot; Mr McWilliam said.  
&quot;It&apos;s a solid investment because the cattle can&apos;t do anything but grow.  
Mr Scott said they aimed to turn over 70,000 to 80,000 head of cattle. About 2000 were being prepared for feedlotting.  
Another outlay is any veterinary costs.  
But the death rate during fattening is less than 1 per cent.  
The buying price listed yesterday was $2.69/kg, with the finished price at $2.31.

			<TEXT>JUST as the French stopped foreign winemakers using the word champagne, Japan is set to ban foreign-bred cattle from being described as wagyu beef.  
In a decision that will muddy the waters of Australia&apos;s $7 billion beef industry, Japan&apos;s Ministry of Agriculture warned it would reject any &quot;incorrectly labelled&quot; beef.  
With richly intense flavours, wagyu enjoys a cult following similar to Penfold&apos;s Grange. Prime cuts from pure-bred steers fetch up to $150 a kilogram in the US and Japan.  
The prized beef is being bred in Australia by businessmen including Harvey Norman&apos;s Gerry Harvey and Flight Centre&apos;s Graham &quot;Skroo&quot; Turner and actor Russell Crowe.  
Japan&apos;s new labelling rules are expected to be formally approved within days.  
The ministry is insisting that only cattle born and raised from Japanese breeds inside Japan will be able to be sold as wagyu.  
One of Australia&apos;s biggest wagyu producers, Brisbane-based Australian Agricultural Company (AAco), believes exporters may have to call the meat Australian marbled beef.  
But the decision was unlikely to harm Australian beef exports overall because the industry enjoyed a favourable reputation abroad, AAco&apos;s international business manager, Peter Cabassi, said.  
Mr Cabassi said he had some sympathy with the Japanese position. &quot;In all honestly I think the Japanese have a point,&quot; he said.  
&quot;For ages we were sending up cross-bred as wagyu.&quot;

			<TEXT>DESPITE the bad news afflicting the agricultural sector in recent weeks, with a worsening drought and continued water shortages, Australia&apos;s biggest cattle company is trumpeting its successes to the market.   
Australian Agricultural Company told the stock exchange yesterday that the company was thriving this year.   
Brisbane-based AAco runs more than 560,000 head of cattle on 24 stations in Queensland and the Northern Territory, and better than average rainfall on many of its properties has resulted in a strong season.   
The company has been moving its operations to northern Australia over the past two years.   
&quot;Unlike the southern half of Australia, the majority of AAco&apos;s properties are experiencing an above-average season with ample supply of pasture and stock water,&quot; the company said.   
&quot;AAco&apos;s cattle are in excellent condition, with weights of growing cattle above average.&quot;   
The company also said the fundamental strength in demand for Australian beef overseas and domestically continued. The statement was prompted by falling prices on the Eastern Young Cattle Index from a Christmas 2005 price of about $3.65 a kilogram to below $3 yesterday, AAco chief financial officer Stephen Toms said. The EYCI is a price average of young cattle from 26 saleyards in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. As exports made up a large proportion of the company&apos;s sales, AAco was not affected by the EYCI, Mr Toms said.   
&quot;The EYCI has shown a plummeting price over the past few weeks and we just wanted our shareholders to know that drought isn&apos;t affecting the main asset in AAco,&quot; Mr Toms said. &quot;We&apos;re selling out of our feedlots mostly into the export markets, and we&apos;re selling our grass-fed cattle into the live export market. We&apos;re not selling into the domestic market in the southern states where the prices have fallen so dramatically.   
&quot;All we&apos;re trying to say is that our markets are fine, that our herds are in good condition and we&apos;re not suffering from the drought.&quot;   
The company&apos;s half-yearly results to June 30 this year, which were released in August, back up AAco&apos;s confidence.   
The company reported a 27 per cent increase in net profit for the comparable period in 2005 -- rising to $8.5 million from $6.7 million.   
&quot;We&apos;ve had across all of our stations about 30 per cent more rain than in a normal season,&quot; Mr Toms said.   
&quot;The Northern Territory properties are all in very good condition. It&apos;s the best season they&apos;ve had for years.&quot;   
But CommSec chief equities analyst Craig James warned that rural-dependent stocks would remain under pressure into next year when El Nino conditions were likely to peak.   
&quot;The indirect effects of the drought are also significant, although harder to calculate,&quot; Mr James said.   
&quot;Less grain produced means less income for transport companies, reduced farm incomes translate to less spending in regional towns, affecting employment and reducing incomes.   
&quot;The Australian economy is more vulnerable to the negative effects of a major drought than at any point in the past 25 years.&quot;   
AACo shares finished down 0.5 at $1.675.

$1.90  
THE world&apos;s largest beef producer, the Brisbane-based Australian Agricultural Company, plans to spend $97 million to acquire two cattle stations in the Northern Territory from the mother of its former chief executive.  
The Anthony Lagoon and Eva Downs station properties currently belong to Janet Holmes a Court&apos;s Heytesbury group, who&apos;s son Peter ran AACo until 2003.  
Chairman Nick Burton Taylor told shareholders at yesterday&apos;s annual general meeting that the properties covered 936,000 hectares, or 2.3 million acres, carrying 62,000 head of quality brahman and brahman charolais cross cattle.  
&quot;This is an opportunity to acquire two outstanding stations with both breeding capacity and growing and fattening capabilities on their extensive lake systems,&quot; he said.  
The chairman said the board intended to pay a similar dividend this year to 2005, but there would be zero franking credits this year and that was likely to continue in future years as the company grew its herd.  
AACo, which recorded a $16.8 million net profit for the 2005 calendar year, said it was expanding its portfolio through further expansion into the lucrative wagyu beef market.  
AACo had plans to increase wagyu production from 8,000 head per year to 25,000 head per year in five years.  
AACo chief executive Don Mackay said global beef would remain strong and the company was convinced the industry had a positive outlook.

			<TEXT>&quot;It&apos;s a good breeding property, it&apos;s good black clay soil country&quot;   
AUSTRALIAN Agricultural Company will auction off its glamour Wrotham Park Station in far north Queensland later this year to fund its expansion into wagyu.   
Managing director Don Mackay yesterday said the company was concentrating on its wagyu assets, which were not suitable for the northern climate.   
He said the country&apos;s biggest cattle producer wanted to expand near its other land assets in the Northern Territory.   
The 596,000ha property is expected to fetch a seven-digit sum and is likely to be auctioned through Elders in June or July.   
Most of the 36,000 head of cattle currently on the station are expected to be sold with the property.   
AACo has owned the station since 1963 and was a joint developer of a luxury tourist resort on the station in 2003, which now is sub-leased by Voyages.   
Herron Todd White director Peter Honnef said cattle property prices remained buoyant with Wrotham Park likely to attract a lot of attention.   
&quot;It&apos;s a name-type of place with a history of performance . . . it&apos;s a good breeding property, it&apos;s good black clay soil country,&quot; Mr Honnef said.   
&quot;There&apos;s a number of potential buyers looking for big area stations. They are limited in number.&quot;   
But he said some vendors had been disappointed recently as prices had not been reaching the highs of the post-Stanbroke sell-off.   
Mr Mackay said the company was likely to look for properties in southern Queensland for its wagyu.   
AACo shares closed up 2 at $1.97.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIA&apos;S biggest cattle producer expects to get its day in court, with a trial date in its stoush over the sale of former rival Stanbroke Pastoral Company to be set in the next few weeks.   
Australian Agricultural Company has been trying to recoup the $2.2 million to $2.5 million it says it spent on its unsuccessful bid for Stanbroke in 2003.   
At the time the Brisbane-based company said it had offered Stanbroke&apos;s then owner, AMP, $40 million more than the $490 million paid by the winning Nebo bid.   
The consortium eventually sold the company to Victorian farmer Peter Menegazzo, who last year died in a plane accident. The subsequent sell-off of Stanbroke cattle properties after the AMP sale spurred the biggest change-over of land in the industry in recent memory.   
AACo chief executive Don Mackay told The Courier-Mail he expected to hear about a trial date &quot;in the not-too-distant future&quot;. But Mr Mackay said the company was concentrating on plans to double its herd size to more than a million head of cattle in the next 10 years while extending its reach into branded products.   
&quot;We focus on the things that make a real difference to our business,&quot; he said.   
AACo in 2004 sold off its stake in the ill-fated Jesters Jaffle Pies. It recently bought the remaining stake in Brisbane-based food distributor Chef&apos;s Partner. The company&apos;s branded products, including the 1824 label -- named after the year the company was established -- and its wagyu premium beef labels are expected to lead its future growth.   
&quot;Wagyu is very much our Versace gown. It opens doors for us in Asia and the United States,&quot; he said. &quot;We have a real opportunity to make a difference in wagyu.&quot;   
The ban on US beef into Japan was also an opportunity for Australian beef producers to push their clean production reputation, he said.

			<TEXT>FLOODWATERS are slowly making their way through the Channel Country, turning parts of Queensland&apos;s drought-stricken southwest into a sea of opportunity.  
Yesterday, water from Cooper Creek spread across a 20km front on South Galway, the Australian Agricultural Company property which has been in drought for the past five years.  
Even dingoes were making a dash for safety as water spread through the channels that soon will produce winter fodder for the 2700 head of cattle on the 505,000ha property.  
&quot;We should run an average of 16,000 to 18,000 head and sometimes up to 22,000 but the prolonged dry has forced the cutback,&quot; station manager John Rickertt said. &quot;But within a month, 1000 head will arrive and more will be trucked here because the prospect now is for a good season.&quot;  
Mr Rickertt said the &quot;handy but not major&quot; flooding -- a result of the heavy rain associated with Cyclone Larry, which devastated Innisfail on the east coast -- came down the Thomson and Barcoo rivers and into the Cooper.  
The water had reached the property after a passage of more than 500km and had been rising for two weeks.  
Properties downstream would benefit and water would probably flow well into South Australia, although Mr Rickertt did not believe it would reach the Birdsville Track.  
Barcoo Shire mayor Bruce Scott said Cooper Creek was falling at Windorah, which remained cut off by road.  
&quot;The further south the Cooper goes through the shire, the more it spreads,&quot; he said.  
&quot;But for properties outside the creek&apos;s influence, it is still as dry as chips.&quot;

			<TEXT>Peter Cabassi, 39,  
Wagyu Beef general manager, Australian Agricultural Company  
Peter Cabassi grew up on a beef cattle property in Western Australia and is one of the pioneers of wagyu beef marketing in Australia. Cabassi will travel to Hong Kong in May when the Hong Kong Jockey Club will be having a promotion featuring Australian-produced wagyu beef.  
What is wagyu beef?  
Wagyu literally translates as &quot;Japanese cattle&quot; and the wagyu beef we produce in Australia is derived predominantly from the Japanese black wagyu breed. It is world famous and our CEO likes to call it the Versace of beef.  
Where does Queensland wagyu beef go?  
Most of our brands (Kobe Cuisine and Darling Downs) go to Japanese, Korean and Hong Kong supermarkets and to restaurants in the US, Hong Kong, Australia, Indonesia and Malaysia.  
How has it been accepted by chefs and restaurateurs?  
There was almost immediate uptake in Asia and since the supply of wagyu has increased over the past four years there is now no self-respecting chef who hasn&apos;t tried it and is regularly selling it. It is now rightfully reputed to be the best beef to serve and is expected to be on menus in the great restaurants.  
How should it be prepared?  
The content of marbling fat can vary from 5 per cent fat up to 30 per cent fat, so the serving style should reflect the type of cut and the level of marbling in the cut. One thing is for sure, consumers should be aware of the marbling grade of the wagyu meat before deciding how they would like it prepared.  
How do you like your steak?  
Rib eye or sirloin, no more than 250g, marble grade 5 or 6, cooked on a hot pan to medium and served on a pre-warmed plate. Preferably seasoned on both sides with sea salt flakes during the cooking process.  
Have you ever considered becoming a vegetarian?  
My ancestors and lifestyle would never allow it.  
Besides steak, what would be your favourite meat dish?  
A simple spit roast of wagyu or lamb. The basting of these meats from the spit sends me into a carnivorous frenzy.  
Where would you go to eat a good steak?  
Hong Kong and the US buy most of our great prime cuts so I have had memorable experiences at Prime in the Bellagio Las Vegas, Nobu in Malibu and The Steakhouse in the Intercontinental in Kowloon. Here at home I&apos;ve spent a lot of time working with chefs such as David Pugh, Javier Codina and Frank Correnti, so wherever they are plying their trade, I&apos;ll know to expect a truly great steak dish.  
What would you wash it down with?  
When at the barbecue I love a full- flavoured, ice-cold lager like Heineken or Boags Premium. When dining out I enjoy a luscious chardonnay (Voyager Estate or Bannockburn) just as much.  
I&apos;m not a big red drinker but indulge in a Quartz Reef Pinot Noir (NZ) whenever I find it.  
What do you eat when you&apos;re in a hurry?  
I&apos;m crazy for sliced prosciutto or dried Italian sausage accompanied by fresh, crusty bread, mild cheddar cheese and a milky coffee.  
What can&apos;t you eat?  
There isn&apos;t much and that makes travelling overseas easier. Although sashimi-style &quot;barnacles&quot; taken fresh from the rocks at Hyundae Beach in Busan, Korea, would be difficult to repeat.  
What is your perfect meal?  
A surf and turf royale -- poached WA marron accompanying a pan-seared, medium Master Kobe sirloin. Side of vanilla beans and asparagus and a selection of condiments (horseradish, wasabi and hot English mustard).

			<TEXT>BRITISH beef exports will resume next month, finally ending the ban brought in a decade ago to stem the spread of mad cow disease.  
Locally, shares in the Australian Agricultural Company fell 1.6 per cent or 3 to $1.80, after Britain&apos;s rural affairs department said exports would resume on May 3.  
UK supermarket buyers will face serious competiton, after having dominated the domestic market&apos;s pricing structures since March 1996.  
European officials agreed to lift the ban as a result of plummeting cases of BSE in cattle in the UK.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIA&apos;S biggest beef producer has bought the biggest full-blood herd of wagyu cattle outside Japan -- to triple its output of the premium beef.  
The Brisbane-based Australian Agricultural Company yesterday paid $1 million to buy 133 bulls from Australian wagyu pioneers the Walker family, from Tarana near Bathurst in New South Wales.  
It has the option of buying the rest of the Westholme wagyu herd for $9 million later this year including access to embryos, semen and intellectual property.  
Managing director Don Mackay said the company was aiming at having 25,000 head of wagyu cattle from the 8000 it currently marketed.  
&quot;Most of it goes overseas but it&apos;s become much more common in restaurant menus in Australia,&quot; Mr Mackay said.  
&quot;It&apos;s popular in Japan, Korea and the US. The US was our biggest (customer) by volume in the past couple of years.&quot;  
He said the Westholme cattle were considered the best genetics available in Australia and the company would breed substantial numbers of full-blood wagyu cattle.  
AACo last week added Darling Downs wagyu to its premium Kobe and Master Kobe wagyu brands. Revenue for its branded products including wagyu rose by 25 per cent in the 2005 full year to $40 million.

			<TEXT>DON Mackay was not a happy camper when he sat down to lunch on Tuesday.   
Indeed, those at Don&apos;s table felt he was distinctly disgruntled.   
Over the past five years or so, the Australian Agricultural Company, which Don runs, has put in place a strategy, as near as you can in Australia, to drought proof its massive cattle-growing operation.   
The group, which controls nearly eight million hectares across northern Queensland and the Northern Territory, has upgraded its properties and its massive herd, which stood at more than 630,000 head at June 30. It has also built up its feedlot operation as well as its portion-controlled food services division and worked, with some success, to build meat brands, with its premium 1824 brand -- named for the date of the company&apos;s birth -- the prime example.   
It has also implemented a tracing system -- along with much of the rest of the beef industry -- that can follow a cut of beef from its home paddock in the Gulf Country or the Barkly Tablelands to the plate of a Japanese or Korean consumer, a system designed to take advantage of Australia&apos;s image as a disease-free and clean green supplier.   
Analysts believe AACo has further gains to make from this vertical integration strategy, and is poised, medium-term, to take lucrative advantage of rising living standards in South East Asia and China, which many analysts believe will lead to a boom in demand for protein, a la the current boom in demand for metals and energy resources.   
Continued P28   
Sudden sale gives plenty to beef about   
From P27   
But who will benefit from that scenario, if it unfolds, and AACo&apos;s prime position to take advantage of it, is now up in the air.   
Don&apos;s Tuesday indigestion was caused by a call from his counterpart at Futuris Corp, Les Wozniczka saying Futuris was putting its $300 million-plus 43 per cent stake in AACo up for auction.   
As any buyer who bids for Futuris&apos; stake must make a takeover offer for the whole of AACo, Mackay and his board&apos;s task now is try to ensure shareholders get true value for their investment -- which has done nicely in capital growth terms since its stock exchange listing but wasn&apos;t, apparently, spinning off enough cash to suit Futuris.   
Broker Credit Suisse recently began researching AACo, initially rating it ``outperform&apos;&apos;. The broker&apos;s major plus points were that AACo offers exposure to expected rises in both land and cattle prices with CS saying it expected ``consumption of meat to continue to grow at about 3 per cent a year, as it has for the past three decades, while available grazing land remains static (or falls)&apos;&apos;.   
CS said at the same time, global herd numbers had fallen. ``Continued population growth, rapidly rising incomes in Asia, continued demands on agricultural land from industry and population growth should exacerbate the demand/supply imbalance,&apos;&apos; the broker said.   
ABN Amro Morgans analyst Belinda Moore said AACo&apos;s land holdings made it an ``irreplaceable asset&apos;&apos; with the sale likely to attract strong interest.   
She said AACo should not simply be assessed on an earnings basis. ``We believe investors should (rather) look at the underlying real estate value of its rural properties.&apos;&apos;   
She believes AACo&apos;s properties will continue to increase in value because they are in high-rainfall areas, will continue to improve their carrying capacity, and when pastoral lease laws change -- in the next year or two, she thinks -- AACo will be able to grow other higher-value crops.   
And she put a possible fair price on AACo&apos;s shares, saying: ``If a takeover premium of 20 per cent is applied on top of a $A3.14 a share `sum-of-the-parts methodology&apos; valuation, then if any full takeover bid were to eventuate it would need to be at least $3.77 a share&apos;&apos; -- which compares with AACo&apos;s Friday close   
of $3.12.

AACo   
+28c   
$3.08   
SHARES in cattle producer  Australian Agricultural Co closed 10 per cent higher yesterday as its major shareholder  Futuris Corp said its 43 per cent stake, which Futuris put on the market on Tuesday, was already attracting considerable interest.   
AACo&apos;s shares closed the day up 28 at $3.08 -- with ABN Amro Morgans analysts Belinda Moore saying a full takeover of the group would need to be pitched at at least $3.77 to reflect the value of the group&apos;s huge land holdings.   
Ms Moore said AACo&apos;s cattle stations -- which cover about 1.2 per cent of Australia&apos;s land mass -- were an ``irreplaceable asset&apos;&apos;, with the sale of the Futuris AACo stake therefore likely to attract strong overseas and local interest.   
She said that over the past 25 years, A-grade agricultural land values in northern Australia -- where AACo&apos;s stations are spread across Queensland and the Northern Territory -- had increased 16.5 per cent a year, reflecting its scarcity.   
If a takeover premium of 20 per cent was applied on top of a $3.14-a- share ``sum-of-the-parts methodology&apos;&apos; valuation, then if any full takeover bid were to eventuate it would need to be at at least $3.77 a share, Ms Moore said.   
Futuris spokesman Don Murchland said the interest in Futuris&apos;s stake had been expected given the high quality of AAco&apos;s assets.   
Futuris said on Tuesday it had appointed Citi and Caliburn to conduct a global search for a buyer or buyers for its 43 per cent stake -- which will require a full takeover bid for AACo if it is snapped up by a single party.   
While some observers believe Futuris may have been bid for its stake before it decided to auction it, Mr Murchland said: ``There&apos;s been a lot of interest from the moment it was announced&apos;&apos;, without indicating where the interest was coming from.   
Futuris has said it hopes to work with AACo&apos;s board on the sale, but has also made it clear its major priority is getting the best value on behalf of its own shareholders -- value it says has not been reflected on the sharemarket.   
``We would seek to co-operate with the AACo board in the process to the extent practicable,&apos;&apos; Mr Murchland said yesterday.   
AACo is Australia&apos;s biggest beef cattle producer and had a herd of more than 631,000 cattle at June 30 across some 27 properties.   
AACo&apos;s shares surged to $3.20 in early trade, still well shy of the high of $3.38 they reached in August, before pulling back later in the day.   
Potential buyers of Futuris&apos;s stake range from  Macquarie Bank to Philippines group San Miguel, Cargill of the US and Brazil&apos;s JBS Fri Boi group or a compatriot and even perhaps New Zealand entrepreneur Graham Hart.

			<TEXT>THE nation&apos;s biggest landholder, Australian Agricultural Company, is up for sale.   
Major shareholder Futuris Group yesterday announced it was selling its 43 per cent stake in the huge Queensland-based cattle producer, which controls nearly 8 million hectares of prime pastoral property in Queensland and the Northern Territory.   
The decision has surprised some observers, coming as it does with cattle prices not particularly high and the soaring Australian dollar eating into export returns.   
Analysts speculated yesterday that bidders could include Teys Brothers and overseas groups such as Cargill of the US and Brazil&apos;s JBS group, which earlier this year bought meat processor Australian Meat Holdings.   
But the prime suspect is Macquarie Bank&apos;s pastoral fund.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIAN Agricultural Company, the country&apos;s biggest landholder, is up for sale with its major shareholder yesterday putting its 43 per cent stake on the block.   
The decision by  Futuris Corp to sell out of the huge Queensland-based cattle producer -- which controls nearly eight million hectares of prime pastoral property in Queensland and the Northern Territory -- could provide some curly questions for Australia&apos;s Foreign Investment Review Board, should a foreign buyer appear on the scene.   
It also surprised some observers, coming as it does with cattle prices not particularly high and the soaring Australian dollar eating into export returns.   
This led ABN Amro Morgans analyst Belinda Moore ``to speculate&apos;&apos;, as she put it ``that Futuris must have been bid a very high price for what is a trophy asset&apos;&apos;.   
Among those who might bid for AACo are Brazil&apos;s JBS group, which earlier this year bought meat processor Australian Meat Holdings,  Teys Brothers and overseas groups such as Cargill of the US.   
But perhaps the prime suspect is  Macquarie Bank&apos;s pastoral fund, which recently bought the historic Bulls Run outside Wagga Wagga in NSW for more than $30 million and earlier purchased the Pooginook Merino Sheep Stud in the southern Riverina. Macquarie Pastoral Services director Tim Hornibrook said at the time of the Bulls Run purchase: ``By this time next year we would want to be at $1 billion&apos;&apos; -- though at the time the fund had raised only about $100 million.   
Private equity firms could also be interested, given the experience when  Stanbroke Pastoral Company was sold in 2003 -- and later broken up providing huge profits to the buyers.   
The auction of AACo will test investors&apos; faith in the theory that the mining boom will be followed by an equally massive boom in demand for food products, from grain to dairy -- and the prime beef AACo turns out.   
Futuris yesterday announced it had appointed  Citigroup and Caliburn Partners to market the AACo stake, and hoped to sell it this financial year.   
Futuris chief Les Wozniczka said Futuris ``would endeavour to achieve (a sale outcome) that can obtain the support of AACo&apos;s board&apos;&apos;.   
AACo ``noted&apos;&apos; the Futuris statement and said it was discussing the proposed sale and had formed a committee of non-Futuris associated directors.   
AACo chief executive Don Mackay, part of the committee, was not taking calls after the announcement.   
But if a single buyer snares Futuris&apos;s 43 per cent of AACo it will be required to bid for the rest of the company as it would breach the Corporation Act&apos;s 20 per cent takeovers threshold.   
AACo&apos;s shares were up 30 yesterday, or 12 per cent, to $2.80. At that price, the group was valued at about $720 million -- but its strategic value, to the right buyer, would undoubtedly be significantly more.   
AACo&apos;s shares touched a high of $3.34 in August.   
Mr Wozniczka said Futuris&apos;s AACo stake, worth about $309 million based on yesterday&apos;s price, was a ``wonderful asset&apos;&apos;, but equity markets did not adequately recognise its value in Futuris&apos;s share price.   
``As a result, the directors consider that shareholder value considerations recommend the sale of the shareholding to capture the unrecognised value and enable reinvestment of proceeds within our existing operations where greater shareholder value can be achieved.&apos;&apos;

			<TEXT>ABB Grain slumped yesterday as the grain handler and marketer said the drought would slash profits by a half or more.   
The announcement, sent ABB down nearly 6 per cent.   
That was not the only stark market evidence of how the hope that surged on the back of unseasonally heavy winter rains across the southern part of the continent has been dashed.   
Even Incitec Pivot was under the gun yesterday. The fertiliser group&apos;s shares have soared almost unstoppably because of a dearth of fertiliser worldwide.   
Having run up in the past year from $35 to a recent high of $86.50, Incitec yesterday shed more than 5 per cent, with its scrip off $4.37 to $82.13.   
ABB&apos;s shares finished down 5.6 per cent, or 43 to $7.20. In late July, ABB&apos;s scrip hit $9.50.   
Among other country-based stocks, AWB -- still reeling from its mauling over its sanction-breaching sales of wheat to Iraq -- shed 4.3 per cent, or 10 to $2.23.   
And Australian Agricultural Co, which had been hoping a good southern season would lift cattle prices and cut feed cost, was off 1.8 per cent or 5 to $2.76.   
ABB released a statement yesterday that said uncertain crop conditions due to the drought would have a significant impact on its previous profit guidance.   
ABB had previously foreshadowed net profit of $16 million to $19 million. Instead, the company said, its bottom line was likely to be between $5 million and $8 million.   
``Global influences, including government decisions on grain stocks and pricing, and uncertainty with current crop conditions in Australia are causing extreme volatility on Australian and world grain markets,&apos;&apos; ABB managing director Michael Iwaniw said.   
Mr Iwaniw said ABB&apos;s malting and supply chain businesses continued to perform exceptionally well in difficult conditions.   
He remained comfortable with ABB&apos;s underlying commercial positions.   
``Above all, the farm outlook is mixed,&apos;&apos; Mr Iwaniw said. ``That is markedly different from the uniformly poor conditions we experienced last year.&apos;&apos;

			<TEXT>SOUTH Korea is the next big destination for Australian beef, with a swag of new supermarkets opening up opportunities in the fast-growing Asian nation.   
Australia&apos;s biggest cattle producer  Australian Agricultural Company is pushing its 1824 brand in South Korea which has seen the number of supermarkets grow from 44 in 1999 to 218 in July.   
AACo has a separate branded section for its products in 112 supermarkets owned by Asian giant Emart.   
&quot;Korea is changing rapidly and the estimations of growth are quite terrific,&quot; chief executive Don Mackay said.   
While Australian beef is facing competition from the US after South Korea late last month announced it would allow more imports from the US, the latest figures from Meat and Livestock Australia show demand still strong.   
The beef promotion agency said last week a peak in buying for the traditional Chuseok holiday period this month was likely to be maintained for the rest of the year.   
Mr Mackay said Australia&apos;s other main competitor, Brazil, was losing land used for cattle to its other fast growing commodity -- sugar, which was increasingly being used for ethanol production.   
&quot;The Brazilian beef herd is actually falling and is likely to continue to fall,&quot; he said.   
Brisbane-based AACo&apos;s last half-year profit fell 31 per cent to $5.9 million, but ABN Amro Morgans analysts have upped the stock to a &quot;buy&quot; from a &quot;hold&quot; on the strength of its land portfolio in high rainfall areas.

CEO Don Mackay said the labour shortage was the single biggest challenge to the beef producer.

			<TEXT>FUTURIS reported a 15.2 per cent rise in annual profit yesterday, booking a net profit of $100.7 million for 2006-07, up from $87.4 million.   
The increase came despite severe drought, with the group&apos;s forestry operations making the largest earnings contribution.   
Underlying net profit increased by 15.3 per cent to $101.8 million, while underlying earnings before interest and tax rose 5 per cent to $164.7 million.   
Futuris&apos;s earnings fell in its rural services, its stake through Elders in beef producer  Australian Agricultural Co and its automotive operations.   
The company declared a final dividend of 5.5 a share, up from 5, taking the total dividend for the year to 9.5 a share. Shares were steady at $2.37.

			<TEXT>THE nation&apos;s largest cattle farmer,  Australian Agricultural Co, could be lining up for a full-year loss because of lower cattle prices and a higher local currency, ABN Amro Morgans says.   
The company could have a loss, before one-off items, of $1.6 million for the December 31 year after reporting on Tuesday a first-half profit of $5.9 million.   
That was 31 per cent lower than the previous corresponding period.   
In a report yesterday, ABN Amro Morgans analyst Belinda Moore forecast the loss after earlier tipping a $26 million full-year profit.   
The company had a profit of $10.1 million last year.   
AACo shares dropped another 3 per cent or 10 to $2.89 after falling more than 7 per cent on Tuesday.

			<TEXT>GIANT cattle producer  Australian Agricultural Co&apos;s bottom-line profit slid 31 per cent in the half year ended June -- with factory set-up, marketing costs and delayed cattle sales major factors behind the fall.   
The group is looking to significantly better seasonal conditions to boost the second half.   
It is carefully watching the strength of the Australian dollar and potential adverse effects of US producers regaining access to the Japanese and Korean markets.   
Heavy restrictions on Japan and Korea over a 2003 mad cow disease scare have recently been lifted.   
AACo chief executive Don Mackay said yesterday the group&apos;s net profit was $5.9 million, down from $8.5 million in the corresponding period last year.   
Late rains over some northern stations interrupted mustering and delayed some cattle sales towards the end of the half year. AACo also held back some cattle rather than sell into a soft market.   
Nevertheless, wholesale beef revenues had grown strongly, Mr Mackay said.   
Revenue rose from $85.6 million to $124.2 million for the half and a steady interim dividend of 7 will be paid.   
Cattle numbers were up 12 per cent from the December half to 630,515 and up 19 per cent on the June half of last year. Beef revenues rose by 64 per cent.   
Mr Mackay said an underlying improvement in operating profit had been supported by the $10 million before-costs proceeds of the settlement of legal action with AMP over the AMP&apos;s sale of the  Stanbroke Pastoral Co.
Looking ahead, Mr Mackay said: &quot;There are competing influences that will determine short-term cattle prices and hence inventory values and earnings through to December 2007.&quot; Influences included a return to normal seasons in southern Australia and continuing strong world demand.   
Meat &amp; Livestock Australia predicted this week that Australian exports of beef in 2007 may be 3.3 per cent higher than forecast because of the slower-than-expected re-entry of US supplies into Asian markets.   
AACo finished down 23 to $2.99 yesterday.

			<TEXT>BRANDED beef is a serious business these days. Here in Queensland we have  Australian Agricultural Company&apos;s fine 1824 cuts as well as Darling Downs Wagyu.   
But judges at the Royal Queensland Show recently named Terra Rossa Beef from South Australia as champion branded beef, for the second year running.   
This is a joint venture between Dalriada Meats at Keith and Margaret Street Meats in Mount Gambier.   
The Terra Rossa name is a powerful marketing tool, thanks to the world-famous red soils which produce Coonawarra&apos;s magnificent wines. Apparently, the layer of red dirt over limestone in this corner of South Australia also produces fine pasture.   
We picked up some Terra Rossa sirloins from David Richardson and Lynsay Stephenson of Village Meats at Rosalie and later cooked them on a hot barbecue plate for four minutes per side.   
The result was a very juicy, tender and flavoursome steak.   
At the Fossicking household, how long to cook meat is a hot topic and some members like it well-done. Even the piece we cooked for more than 10 minutes melted in the mouth. Village Meats also sells Terra Rossa rib fillet and rump cuts.   
Regulars know that Richardson likes making interesting, award-winning sausages. His Bangalow sweet pork, stilton and pear bangers are soft and subtle with just a hint of cheese on the back of the palate.   
For something a little earthier, there is a new smoked beef and capsicum sausage.   
Bangalow is a signature brand for Village Meats which cures and smokes pork loins in-house to make a sweet pale bacon.   
Another new product is Golden Plains free-range pork from western Victoria. The outdoor pigs raised in Queensland and northern NSW are usually back Berkshires which can take the strong sunlight up here. On the plains between Geelong and Ballarat, the people behind Western Plains Pork run white pigs which have access to open huts and shelters for birthing and raising piglets.   
It is a neat and humane concept and the pork is nice and juicy, too.   
Have a look at the website:   www.westernplainspork.com   [http://www.westernplainspork.com]
Village Meats is at 155 Baroona Rd, Rosalie (ph: 3367 3396).   
VEAL jus is a handy thing to have in the fridge. A little of this heated and drizzled round a nice steak gives the sort of classy finish found in good restaurants.   
You can make it at home but this is time consuming. Traditionally, a jus is made by slow-roasting veal neck bones with red wine, herbs and vegetables. The pot is simmered for 30 hours or more. The liquid is then strained and reduced further and the result is a rich sauce which doesn&apos;t need thickening with flour.   
A jus made by the chefs at The Commissary in Sydney is now available in Queensland. This is a classically French product in two-litre pouches which keep fresh in the fridge for 42 days.   
Joel Nelson of distributor Jimele (ph: 3808 2037) is an ex-chef and he makes a quick and easy steak and mushroom dish with the jus. Just pan-fry the steaks and put them to one side. Fry some mushrooms, add jus and then the meat for a quick stir before plating up.   
Stockists include Rayners Meats, New Farm; Fancee Fruit, Carindale; Mrs Flannery&apos;s, Taringa; Fig Tree Deli, Camp Hill; Red Deli, Clayfield; Rock&apos;n&apos;Roll, Greenslopes; Spoon, Fortitude Valley; and Feast on Fruit, Morningside.   
PASTRY chef Nicolas Belorgey is gaining a following at Chouquette in New Farm. We chatted recently about his rather striking &quot;religieuse vanille&quot; - two cream-filled choux puffs layered and frosted with a sugar glaze to resemble a nun in her habit. Belorgey also makes croissant aux amandes which are filled with a rich almond-meal cream, and a delicate Italian-style meringue filled with blackcurrant mouse.   
There are plenty of French accents to be heard in this friendly place and it&apos;s cheaper than a plane fare to Paris.

AACo   
-12c   
$2.72   
WHY would your share price jump, the ASX asked  Australian Agricultural Co on Tuesday.   
We don&apos;t have any particular idea, the cattle producer said yesterday.   
But could it be the sudden change across at least southern Australia from drought to flooding rains?   
AACo&apos;s shares surged on Tuesday to a record $2.90, from $2.56 on Friday, prompting an ASX query, to which the company -- whose shares closed yesterday down 12 at $ 2.72 -- replied with a standard &quot;don&apos;t know&quot;.   
But the company repeated yesterday essentially what it told shareholders at its recent annual meeting, that the drought might be lifting -- reinforced by the torrential rains that hit NSW last weekend -- which would benefit it in several ways.   
After tough times -- not so much for AACo itself which runs most of its cattle in well-watered northern Australia -- seasonal conditions for the beef cattle and feedlotting industries (in more southern climes) were rapidly improving, the company said yesterday.   
The rains should help rejuvenate pastures -- taking cattle being sold off by drought stressed producers off the market, and thus stabilising or increasing prices.   
They should also see widespread planting of winter crops which in turn should cut the cost of feed for fattening cattle.   
Some weather forecasters are predicting a La Nina weather event, which would bring above-average rainfall to eastern Australia, so the extended rainfall forecast was looking good, AACo yesterday.   
And &quot;cattle prices may increase as a result of this rain and also the prediction of La Nina conditions&quot;.   
Grain prices, a major cost for feedlotters, may also fall as grain supplies increase late in 2007, AACo said, adding that as a major buyer of grain to fatten its own cattle it should benefit.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIAN Agricultural Co said it had &quot;valuable&quot; rain on three of its Queensland properties in the past week.   
More than 70mm (2.8in) of rain fell on the company&apos;s Goonoo, Glentana and Meteor Downs ranches in central Queensland, chief executive officer Don Mackay said.   
&quot;It&apos;s very valuable rainfall in that area at this time of the year,&quot; he said.   
&quot;It&apos;s also where we farm, so it will allow us to plant some winter crop.&quot;   
Shares in AACo rose 24c, or 9.2 per cent, to $2.84 as more than 800,000 shares changed hands.   
The stock has gained 53 per cent in the past year, more than double the 26 per cent gain in the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index.

			<TEXT>BEEF producer  Australian Agricultural Company believes its huge well-watered land holdings in northern Australia will see it profit from climate change fears.   
In time it expects to become both a seller of carbon offsets and a future producer of high value crops as well as prime cattle.   
In the meantime, it sees the immediate future for beef as fairly rosy, given recent rains in southern Australia and despite the re-entry of the US exporters into its important North Asian markets.   
Chairman Nick Burton Taylor and chief executive Don Mackay told yesterday&apos;s annual meeting AACo saw significant potential to provide &quot;carbon sinks&quot; both to offset its own carbon emissions, from the likes of cattle feedlots, and those of other CO2 emitters.   
AACo has huge land holdings in Queensland and the Northern Territory which account for more than 1 per cent of the Australian land mass.   
Mr Mackay also said after the meeting that AACo hoped a review of pastoral leases, currently being conducted by the Queensland Government, would broaden the uses to which it could put its vast land holdings.   
AACo is not expecting to get into the rice industry, which has been devastated along the Murray River by the current drought and over allocation of the Murray&apos;s now scarce flows.   
But Mr Mackay saw future potential for timber and cereal growing in such areas as Queensland&apos;s Gulf country, with its seasonal but predictable rainfall, as well as for the production of bio-mass -- crops to be turned into &quot;clean&quot; fuels such as ethanol.   
Mr Mackay told shareholders a good wet season in northern Australia, together with recent rain in southern parts, had AACo on track for an improved performance this year.   
&quot;Our performance is expected to be a good deal better than last year,&quot; he said after the meeting. &quot;That is the expectation of the market and we would at this point agree with that.&quot;   
Cattle prices had in the past six months or so been under pressure, with drought- affected producers in southern states selling off stock they could not feed -- and the lower prices had filtered through to important North Asian markets such as Korea, Mr Mackay said.   
The US had also recently resumed exports to North Asia following several years of being ruled out of the market due to &quot;mad cow disease&apos; scares.   
AACo shares fell 4 to $2.56 yesterday.

			<TEXT>A PRIVATE investor has paid more than $7 million for a cold storage facility in Colmslie previously owned by the Port of Brisbane.   
Matthew Frazer-Ryan and Matthew Edwards of  Jones Lang LaSalle negotiated the sale.   
Mr Frazer-Ryan said  Jones Lang LaSalle had been initially appointed to market the property by the Port about 18 months ago.   
However, it was taken off the market when the then tenant had to leave the building.   
The pair negotiated a new lease for the building in September last year to the  Australian Agricultural Company for five years at $568,163 a year and the Port of Brisbane recently decided to try to sell it again.   
An expressions-of-interest campaign for the building at 30 Manton St, Colmslie, produced six offers with the successful buyer winning out partly because of the unconditional nature of the investor&apos;s offer.   
The purpose-built cold storage facility was only five years old.   
Mr Frazer-Ryan said Colmslie and other areas towards the Port were becoming popular precincts for cold storage. The pair have sold more than $4 million worth of cold storage facilities in the area recently.   
They also sold properties at 164 Riverside Place for $3.075 million and 59 Steel Place for $1.4 million, both as part of a $10 million MFS portfolio disposal.   
The Manton St property has a net lettable space of 3980sq m on a 7997sq m parcel of land.   
It is a freestanding cold storage and food processing facility with office space over two levels.   
Mr Edwards said interest was strong in the building because of its position and design.   
It was appealing because it is in the heart of the Australia TradeCoast industrial precinct, reasonably close to the CBD and within easy reach of major arterial roads.   
He said the secure lease profile made it a strong offering.

			<TEXT>CATTLE producer Australian Agricultural Co has settled its Federal Court action against financial services group AMP for $10 million.  
The settlement ends the action sparked by AAco, which was pursuing damages from AMP, alleging a flawed tender process for the sale of Stanbroke Pastoral Company in 2003.  
&quot;Under the settlement AMP pays AAco the sum of $10 million,&quot; AAco said.  
&quot;The settlement vindicates actions taken by AAco pursuing damages from AMP.&quot;  
AMP said the case was settled without any admission of liability and at the request of its insurers.  
The settlement represented less than 9 per cent of the total damages of $115.3 million sought by AAco, AMP said in a statement.  
&quot;AMP remained confident of its legal position and maintained its belief that the Stanbroke sale process was rigorous and that all competing bids were appropriately assessed,&quot; it said.  
AACo began legal action related to the sale of Stanbroke, initially seeking an injunction to stop the sale to the successful bidder, Nebo Holdings and Investments. Its application was later dismissed.  
The present claim was brought by AACo against AMP Life Ltd, the previous owner of Stanbroke, and AMP Henderson Global Investors Ltd, now known as AMP Capital Investors Ltd.  
AMP shares closed steady at $10.72 and AACo rose 6 to $2.30 yesterday.

			<TEXT>FUTURIS yesterday posted a 6 per cent lift in first-half profit, despite the drought, and says it has a solid platform for the rest of the year.  
It also said it would sell its property development operations to West Australian-based Aspen Group for $234 million.  
Futuris reported a first-half net profit of $33.1 million, compared to $31.1 million in the previous corresponding period.  
Gains from its financial services, forestry and property operations had enabled the company to offset the drought.  
The company said its results could still be affected by the weather, despite favourable forecasts. Results also depended on sales of forestry investment schemes and beef producer Australian Agricultural Company.  
Shares rose 1c to $2.16.

			<TEXT>SHARES in Australia&apos;s biggest beef producer jumped to a record high yesterday despite it posting a 40 per cent fall in annual profit.  
Australian Agricultural Company shares rose more than 6 per cent to close up 13 at $2.23 in lively trade.  
Severe drought in the second half of 2006 impacted on its markets resulting in a calendar 2006 net profit of $10.1 million, down from $16.8 million in the previous year but the Brisbane-based producer expected modest price rises in beef this year as conditions eased.  
The result included a $17.3 million writedown of its trading cattle inventory as required under new accounting standards.  
AACo said beef consumption was rising in its key markets in Australia and the US while protocols restricting the access of US beef into Japan and South Korea would continue to provide opportunities.  
Chief executive Don Mackay said world demand for clean, exportable beef remained strong and was growing on a per capita basis.  
&quot;We see cattle prices likely to rise modestly as the effects of the drought start to dissipate,&quot; he said.  
He said northern Australia, which is home to most of the company&apos;s 560,000-strong herd, had enjoyed a great start to the year with strong rainfall.  
&quot;The world has become so engrossed with this thing called climate change that everything that is happening is ascribed to it, and therefore it is all coming to a dreadful sticky end and it&apos;s happening now,&quot; Mr Mackay said.  
&quot;We all need to be a little more measured than that -- northern Australia is enjoying a very good start to the year and the general consensus is that El Nino is breaking down.  
&quot;That is why we are having drought -- because of El Nino.&quot;  
He said AACo&apos;s forward purchase of grain would dilute the impact of grain prices felt in the spot market during 2006.  
He reiterated AACo&apos;s long-term strategy included plans to double the size of the herd by 2015, acquire additional grazing land and improve land-carrying capacities by up to 20 per cent on selected properties.  
Meanwhile, rural services and property group Futuris, which has a stake in AACo, confirmed it was in talks regarding the sale of most of its property assets to the Aspen Group.  
Futuris&apos;s Caversham Property Group manages the development of assets of about $800 million.  
Another agribusiness group, Ruralco, told shareholders at its annual general meeting that it expected to sell off cattle and sheep if the drought continued.  
But Ruralco chairman Andrew Kemp said there had been signs recently of price improvements driven by international demand and the promise of autumn rains.  
He said wool prices were starting to firm as buyers saw a looming shortage in 2007.

			<TEXT>THE nation&apos;s biggest cattle company has good growth prospects this year despite the lingering drought, water shortages and fluctuating beef prices.   
Australian Agricultural Co&apos;s share price yesterday hit a record high and the company is &quot;fundamentally in a very strong position&quot;, according to ABN Amro Morgans analyst Belinda Moore.   
The shares which punched through $2 for the first time since last May closed 8 higher at $2.06 after reaching $2.09 earlier in the day.   
Ms Moore has forecast that the Brisbane-based business, which runs nearly 530,000 head of cattle on 24 stations in Queensland and the Northern Territory, will more than double its net profit to $31.4 million this calendar year and deliver a near identical result in 2008.   
But a recent slide in cattle prices means AACo&apos;s December year net profit result will probably come in at $13.6 million, down from $16.8 million in 2005.   
AACo&apos;s current guidance remains between $16 million and $20 million in after-tax profit, with its full-year results scheduled to be released on February 6.   
The company said in October that it had been moving its operations to northern Australia over the past two years and better than average rainfall on many of its properties had resulted in a strong season. While grain prices have risen sharply, AACo has shielded itself by forward purchasing much of its feed through September.   
Chief executive Don Mackay did not return calls seeking comment but Ms Moore believes the company represents good value for investors.   
&quot;The underlying fundamentals of the business remain sound -- above average wet season, productivity improvements, investments in future growth and ongoing strength in rural property prices,&quot; she wrote in a recent client briefing note.   
&quot;AACo&apos;s share price is being affected by the impact of lower beef prices. In our view, this provides a buying opportunity for longer-term investors.&quot;

			<TEXT>COOLER weather and good rains have sparked a resurgence in agricultural-based stocks as hopes grow of an easing in the drought.  
The CommSec AgStocks Index, which includes Queensland Cotton, Australian Agricultural Company and AWB, has risen 16 per cent since its recent low in late October.  
This compares with the All Ordinaries gaining just 5.7 per cent over the same period.  
Since October, the strongest gains have been recorded by Incitec Pivot, up 45 per cent, while AWB and GrainCorp have both risen 24 per cent.  
CommSec analyst Charles Hyde said agricultural stocks typically bottomed around October-December and then rallied in the new year.

			<TEXT>BEEF producer Australian Agricultural Company has agreed to sell five of its 26 properties to Australian agricultural investor Primary Holdings International.
The properties and cattle involved have a book value of about $250 million.
The proposed transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and Primary Holdings arranging finance.
``AACo expects the acquisition consideration payable by (the) Primary Holdings International transaction will be reflective of its NTA (net tangible assets) of $2.79 per share,&apos;&apos; AACo said yesterday.
AACo participates in the raising of the cattle on the properties by entering into a cattle management joint venture with Primary Holdings.
AACo said it would use the sale proceeds to retire debt and implement a capital management program that included a share buyback, if the proposed transaction was finalised.
Last week, AACo said it expected to post an earnings loss for calendar 2008 as the global financial crisis cut beef prices.
Global beef markets are not expected to recover until early 2009 once import stocks are run down. The price of beef had fallen 30/kg since September.
AACo shares rose 14.5 to $1.825 yesterday.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIAN Agricultural Co is in talks with a number of funds and investors to sell an undisclosed amount of its properties as it moves to reduce debt amid the global credit crunch.
It also warns that the global crisis has started to directly hurt beef prices and it now expects an accounting loss for the year to December 31. The scale of the loss won&apos;t be known until late January.
Properties owned by Australia&apos;s largest beef cattle company comprise about 1.2 per cent of the nation&apos;s land mass.
Chief executive Stephen Toms said yesterday proceeds from property sales would be used to retire debt, lift herd numbers, add earnings diversity through fee-based income, undertake alternative agribusiness, and execute carbon-related initiatives.
Mr Toms said prices for good quality rural properties in northern Australia had continued to improve in the past year.
AACo has 565,000 beef cattle on 24 cattle stations and feedlots, mainly in northern Australia.
Mr Toms said beef prices had slumped by 9 per cent since hitting an 18-month high in September.
The chief cause of the drop is the failure of some traders and wholesalers in the US, Japan and Korea to gain access to credit lines, which has caused a drop in the number of orders.
The company said that for most of 2008, it had had to endure high interest costs, very high grain costs, drought mitigation expenses related to the Barkly breeding herd, an uncompetitive Australian dollar and high oil prices.
In addition, the rapid fall in interest rates would mean a negative mark-to-market non-cash impact on the company&apos;s hedged interest position.
But AACo said all of these elements were expected to reverse in 2009 and Mr Toms told investors it was ``worth keeping things in perspective&apos;&apos;.
``Over the company&apos;s 184-year history, it has weathered two depressions and any number of recessions and not only survived but continued to prosper. AAco remains a strong, robust company,&apos;&apos; he said.
About half of AACo&apos;s $407 million net debt is due for refinancing in January 2010, with the remainder to roll over in January 2011.
AACo plans to cut its overheads by $20 million or 15 per cent in 2009, starting with a reduction of corporate costs and measures to include savings in labour, feed, transport and mustering costs.
Its shares yesterday rose 1.2 per cent to close at $1.68.

			<TEXT>BEEF cattle giant Australian Agricultural Co felt the pinch of higher fuel, labour and feed costs in the half year, reporting a bottom line net loss of $2.2 million.
The result was down from the $5.9 million profit recorded in the 2007 first half.
But new chief executive Stephen Toms yesterday said AACo&apos;s operating cash flow for the June 30 half was $5.9 million, compared with a negative cash flow of $20 million a year earlier.
And Mr Toms said AACo expected ``a rapid increase in cattle prices in the remainder of the year&apos;&apos;.
Which left the share market unimpressed, however, with AACo shares, which touched $3.18 during the day, ending steady at $3.01.
Mr Toms, who was officially appointed yesterday after acting in the CEO&apos;s role since May, said the cash flow improvement was primarily attributable to the sale of a number of breeding cattle held over from 2007.
These had been moved earlier than the group would have liked, largely because of a sub-par year at its Barkly Tablelands stations, which increased feeding costs and led to increased agistment costs for cattle not sent on to AACo-owned properties.
And the dry season on the Barkly meant a swag of such cattle were sold.
Mr Toms said they nevertheless sold at significantly higher prices than would have been achieved had they not been held over from 2007.
He told The Courier-Mail yesterday the costs of their sale, like transport, would now not affect the second-half result.
Mr Toms also said that in the first six months of 2007 AACo booked a
$10 million legal settlement from AMP, following AACo&apos;s failed earlier attempt to buy the Stanbroke Pastoral Company.
High feed prices, a high Australian dollar and the return of the US to Japanese and Korean beef markets also affected export returns.
But the Aussie has recently come down and AACo also noted that Australian cattle prices had been on the rise since June.
ABN Amro Morgans analyst Belinda Moore said that the good operating cash flow was a positive, but investors should look at the real estate value of the company&apos;s properties and the potential for a takeover.
``Property sales in its area continue to increase in value,&apos;&apos; Ms Moore wrote.
AACo&apos;s interim dividend will be 7 a share.

			<TEXT>LEADING broking analysts were taken by surprise yesterday after industrial conglomerate Futuris Corporation slashed its earnings guidance.
Less than a week out from balance date, Futuris shocked investors with the news that its full-year net profit would come in at between $80 million and $85 million.
The revised guidance is about 20 per cent lower than previous consensus forecasts which ranged as high as
$101 million.
The market&apos;s response was sharp and devastating.
Futuris scrip was pummelled all day and closed down 37, or 27 per cent, at a five-year low of 97. The share price has halved in the past five weeks.
Chairman and chief executive Les Wozniczka said the profit downgrade was attributable to lower than expected revenue from the ITC forest investments business, negative returns from the interest in Australian Agricultural Co and higher debt servicing costs.
``Demand for managed investment scheme (MIS) products in the year to date has proved to be significantly weaker than in the previous year,&apos;&apos; Mr Wozniczka told the ASX.
``On the basis of sales to date, it appears improbable that ITC&apos;s 2008 MIS sales will match the level recorded in the previous year.&apos;&apos;
Futuris&apos;s financial services business, which includes the Elders Rural Bank joint venture with Bendigo Bank, has been the driver of group earnings in recent times, but Mr Wozniczka warned that earnings growth would begin to slow in 2009.
He said the company would sharpen its focus on core businesses next year, which include its Elders Rural Services arm, the financial services division and ITC.
The group plans to offload its 43 per cent stake in AACo.
``Should other parties wish to make a realistic offer for our shareholding in AACo, then we would consider the offer on its merits and, if acceptable, take it forward,&apos;&apos; Mr Wozniczka said.
The earnings disappointment has left some investors out in the cold after the group was upgraded to ``buy&apos;&apos; by a string of brokers earlier this month.

			<TEXT>AFTER a boardroom cull at Australian Agricultural Company on Wednesday, Futuris has set about rebuilding AACo&apos;s board but faced investor concerns over its methods and potential conflicts of interest.
Futuris, frustrated by what it said was a stymied bid to sell its 42.9 per cent AACo stake, used Wednesday&apos;s annual shareholder meeting of the Brisbane-based beef producer and massive landowner to oust chairman Nick Burton Taylor.
Two AACo directors protested at its methods by immediately resigning.
AACo&apos;s ousted chairman also revealed AACo was to enter a mediation process over a dispute of ``significant&apos;&apos; size relating to animal supplements with Futuris unit Elders.
Australian Shareholders&apos; Association spokesman Ian Miller said the ASA would be monitoring how the situation is managed given Futuris managing director Les Wozniczka is an AACo director and Futuris board member Charles Bright is AACo&apos;s new acting chairman.
``Not just two Futuris directors, but the Futuris managing director, are AACo directors while this matter is handled. They must have some divided loyalties.
``To follow good governance they would have to not partake in any related talks,&apos;&apos; Mr Miller said.
Futuris yesterday said Mr Bright was acting chairman and Philip Toyne was a new independent director, forming a three-person board with Mr Wozniczka and there are plans to appoint further independent directors. AACo chief financial officer Stephen Toms is acting CEO and takes charge of CEO recruitment.
Mr Wozniczka said Futuris hadn&apos;t wanted the two independent directors to resign and therefore hadn&apos;t engineered a situation in which two of the three current board members were Futuris directors at a time of AACo-Elders mediation.
``We didn&apos;t expect or ask for this situation. But there is a clear process in place to handle this as for any commercial dispute. New independent directors will be briefed by AACo management, not by us, and AACo management will have their own legal advisers,&apos;&apos; Mr Wozniczka said.
He said the most important strategic priority for AACo was to get its costs right and defend market share, given major operational challenges such as rain-starved properties on the Barkly Tablelands and the strong dollar.
``The last thing I would want to see is management running around pursuing all sorts of strategic rabbits and not focusing on core operations,&apos;&apos; said Mr Wozniczka, who told shareholders Futuris wasn&apos;t seeking or encouraging offers for its stake.
Some analysts expressed surprise AACo&apos;s share price was holding up and put it down to expectations it was back in play as a takeover target and due to forecasts for rising net tangible asset growth this year on rising land values.
One analyst said if not for this the stock would be falling, given the way Futuris rode roughshod over minority shareholders by effectively dismantling its board.
``Futuris&apos;s actions were a disgrace,&apos;&apos; said one analyst at a major brokerage who preferred not to be named. ``It&apos;s acting in its own interests and doesn&apos;t care about the interests of any other shareholders. Its actions look to be about positioning the company for sale process number two and that&apos;s likely why the stock price is higher.
``Otherwise, the stock would be down, given the company is being dragged through the mud, having lost two managing directors in a matter of months. We&apos;re keen to see who the new management team will be and how long they&apos;re going to be there for. They need to put more directors in place and you have to wonder how independent those directors are going to be,&apos;&apos; the analyst said.
AACo shares rose 5 to $3.04, Futuris shed 1 to $1.85.

			<TEXT>Good old-fashioned Wild West showdown it was
THE Australian Agricultural Co&apos;s AGM on Wednesday was as close as you get on the corporate scene to a good old-fashioned Wild West showdown.
All the ingredients were there, bar the six-shooters -- even the Paladar Fumidor cuban cigar saloon just down the road from where the meeting was held at the Brisbane Convention Centre.
With major shareholder Futuris having ousted Nick Burton Taylor as chairman, leading to two independent directors resigning in protest, AACo&apos;s new three-man board includes Futuris board member Charles Bright as acting chairman and Futuris managing director Les Wozniczka.
Bright, an investment banker, told shareholders he runs a rural operation north of Melbourne. ``It has dirt and, hopefully, grass. We get our hands dirty in the pursuit of wealth.&apos;&apos;
Some shareholders suggested he and Wozniczka appeared to be wearing too many hats, particularly with a legal dispute entering mediation between AACo and Futuris&apos;s Elders.
Tucker dies
GRAHAM Tucker, who over a long and distinguished career as one of Queensland&apos;s most respected professional directors became known at one point as ``the chairman of everything&apos;&apos;, died yesterday after a long battle with cancer.
Tucker was a former Queensland senior partner of what is now KPMG.
He founded oil and gas group Crusader and was the inaugural chairman of the Queensland Industry Development Corp.
He was called in to remove the establishment board of Evans Deakin when that group was in dire straits, and was a long-time director and the Goss government-appointed chairman of Suncorp.
While not always loved, he was held in high esteem by his peers in the business community as someone whose sense of duty and personal honesty were above reproach.
Eagles merge
OLD Brisbane law firm Nicol Robinson Halletts announced plans yesterday to merge with larger southern-based rival Herbert Geer &amp; Rundle.
NRH boss Greg Meek is adamant his firm has not been taken over, preferring to describe the union as ``an integration&apos;&apos;.
But the 78 staff and eight partners in Brisbane will now be under the Herbert name, which may change after July 1.
Meek parachuted into the manager&apos;s job at Nicol Robinson Halletts earlier this year to focus on ``aggressively pursuing an eastern seaboard presence&apos;&apos;.
He&apos;s certainly got that now with Herbert, which has offices in Sydney and Melbourne and was looking to expand in Queensland.
No money is changing hands in the deal, Meek says. Combined revenues of the new firm are expected to hit $50 million next year.
``This is the culmination of a mission for me,&apos;&apos; Meek says. ``I&apos;m really happy that I&apos;ve been able to see this over the line.&apos;&apos;

FUTURIS will be fighting for full control of the reins at Australian Agricultural Co today, seeking to oust the chairman but facing board disarray if two directors carry out a threat to resign in protest.
Adelaide-based Futuris, the diversified group whose interests span rural retailer Elders, forestry, horticulture and telecommunications, plans to wield its 43 per cent stake to eject AACo chairman and acting chief executive Nick Burton Taylor.
A Futuris spokesman yesterday said it expected to achieve the simple majority, or more than 50 per cent, of votes cast at the Brisbane meeting or by proxy, but did not want to comment on its future plans for AACo, pending the vote outcome.
Futuris initially had supported resolutions, including Mr Burton Taylor&apos;s re-election, to be put to the annual general meeting of the Brisbane-based beef producer AACo today.
But yesterday Futuris said it had ``determined&apos;&apos; to oppose the motion.
``After close consideration . . . the chairman&apos;s re-election is contrary to (Futuris&apos;s) interests and the best interests of other AACo shareholders. Futuris believes AACo&apos;s best interests can only be served by a board that is unified and working in the interests of all AACo shareholders,&apos;&apos; it said.
It said it had not sought the resignations of Mirvac managing director Greg Paramor and Chris Roberts, two independent directors, who AACo yesterday said had indicated they would stand down as board directors if Futuris rejected Mr Burton Taylor&apos;s re-election.
Futuris declined to comment on media reports yesterday that it aimed to replace Mr Burton Taylor with Charles Bright, an investment banker, Futuris board member and one of its AACo board nominees.
Futuris boss Les Wozniczka reportedly has accused Mr Burton Taylor of stymieing Futuris&apos;s planned sale of its 43 per cent stake. Futuris&apos;s share price was pummelled early this month after it failed to offload the stake by its deadline and said it was abandoning the sale as no offers gave the certainty and timing it wanted.
One analyst said greater Futuris control over AACo could be viewed as a negative given Futuris&apos;s own share price had been under pressure due to investor concerns over its own strategic direction and its management.
``Here&apos;s Futuris trying to take away AACo&apos;s chairman and have more control than in the past at AACo. That&apos;s a bit concerning when they haven&apos;t got their own shop in order,&apos;&apos; the analyst said.
``We need to hear views from both companies on the strategic direction for AACo. But we can see from stock prices that AACo&apos;s outperformed the past four years and Futuris has gone nowhere.&apos;&apos;
AACo shares closed yesterday down 6c at $2.90, with Futuris down 3c at $1.87.
Its shares have been steadily declining from a June peak of $2.83.

$2.84
THE removal of takeover speculation pounded shares of beef cattle producer Australian Agricultural Co yesterday.
Diversified agribusiness company Futuris six months ago put its 43 per cent stake in Brisbane-based AACo on the block but on Tuesday shelved the plan as no deals could be sealed by a June deadline.
Adelaide-based Futuris, whose interests span beef, horticulture, forestry, financial services and telecoms, said it had received proposals but none that gave certainty in terms of timing and execution. Futuris shares slumped 24, or 11.4 per cent, to close at $1.87 yesterday as investors were disappointed it couldn&apos;t use sale proceeds towards reducing its debt levels.
AACo shares fell 29, or 9.3 per cent, to $2.84 despite Futuris saying it saw good prospects from its AACo stake.
AACo said its landholdings had lured ``a high level of market interest&apos;&apos; and it had a responsibility to deliver shareholder value on those assets.
AACo spokesman Nick Burton Taylor, when asked if it was considering talks of its own to pursue that interest, said the comment aimed to show market interest underpinned the assets&apos; value.
``Our assets were rated highly,&apos;&apos; he said.
``We saw that as a positive signal out of the process. We&apos;ll continue to acquire and selectively trim the portfolio to improve performance.&apos;&apos;

FUTURIS Corporation is keeping cattle producer Australian Agricultural Co on its menu, yesterday abandoning plans to sell a 43 per cent stake.
Adelaide-based Futuris, whose interests span beef, horticulture, forestry, financial services and telecommunications, said it had received proposals but none that ``offered certainty&apos;&apos; in terms of timing and execution.
``Futuris has elected to terminate the sale process immediately to bring the necessary certainty for its asset management and strategic planning,&apos;&apos; the company told the stock exchange.
It had planned to sell its stake in Brisbane-based cattle producer AACo by the end of June and reports had put James Packer&apos;s Consolidated Pastoral among the frontrunners.
AACo owns about 8 million hectares of land across Queensland and the Northern Territory, with about 600,000 head of cattle on 27 properties forming about 1.2 per cent of Australia&apos;s land mass.
AACo has teamed up with golf legend Greg Norman to boost exports of its premium wagyu steaks.
Futuris yesterday said it saw juicy prospects from its stake in AACo and that its own fiscal 2008 underlying earnings before interest and taxes were now expected to come in towards the top of the range of market forecasts of $154 million to $183 million. Its 2007 underlying result was $164.7 million.
Its statement came after the close of trading. Futuris shares had closed down 5, or 2.3 per cent, at $2.11, with AACo down 6, or 1.9 per cent, at $3.13, in a lower overall market.

THE world of gaming and media is not enough for James Packer.
As he invests billions in casinos in Macau and Las Vegas, the former media king is now believed to have his eyes on a stake in one of Australia&apos;s biggest property and cattle companies.
Mr Packer&apos;s Consolidated Pastoral has emerged as a likely buyer of Futuris&apos;s 43 per cent stake in Australian Agricultural Company, which has almost 600,000 head of cattle.
AACo also owns a total of 8 million hectares of land across the Northern Territory and Queensland, that&apos;s bigger than Ireland and equal to 1.2 per cent of Australia&apos;s land mass.
Shares in AACo surged in recent days on rumours that a deal was imminent, although the company yesterday would only say the sale was in progress, without specifically mentioning Mr Packer&apos;s name.
The stock rose 9 to $3.19 yesterday.
But analysts say that Consolidated Pastoral has teamed up with another firm, Tipperary Group, to become the likely front-runner in the bidding war.
On top of its property portfolio, AACo exports much sought-after wagyu beef across the world -- having teamed up with golf legend Greg Norman to sell its wagyu steaks to more than 400 restaurants in the US.
Australia&apos;s second-richest man -- behind resources entrepreneur Andrew Forrest -- has been spending billions building mega-casinos in Macau and has extended his gaming interests in the US and Canada.

			<TEXT>THE strong Australian dollar and higher feed costs because of the drought forced  Australian Agricultural Company to yesterday post a 64 per cent slump in after-tax profit to $3.6 million for the year to December 31.   
The result came despite a $10 million windfall from the legal settlement with AMP over the Stanbroke Pastoral sale and despite the inclusion in the 2006 result of a $6 million tax benefit related to the sale of the company&apos;s Wrotham Park station in north Queensland.   
AACo chairman Nick Burton Taylor said the company believed it was in a strong position and well placed for solid growth this year.   
``We believe we are still positioned from a strategic point of view to benefit from investment in land over the past three years and we have significantly increased herd capacity,&apos;&apos; he said.   
Increased sales in wholesale beef helped boost operating revenue 27 per cent to $248.98 million while net assets increased from $582 million to $726 million. Directors declared a final dividend of 9 a share, including a special dividend of 2, compared with last year&apos;s dividend of 7.   
Mr Burton Taylor said the outlook was positive, with cattle prices since the beginning of the new year increasing by 5 per cent and up 17 per cent on the lows of last year.   
The key risks remained the rising dollar for exports and the impact of higher grain prices.   
The chairman said the company was working with  Futuris Corporation on the best method to sell Futuris&apos;s 43 per cent stake in AACo and he hoped this would be resolved by the middle of the year.   
``We are now putting in place a protocol where we are working together on the sale,&apos;&apos; Mr Burton Taylor said.   
He refused to comment on whether potential buyers were local or overseas groups or if  Macquarie Bank&apos;s Pastoral operations was among the frontrunners.   
The future sale comes amid a general shake-up in the rural sector with Dairy Farmers, Australia&apos;s third-largest milk processor, soon to make a recommendation to its farmer shareholders on whether to pursue a trade sale, merger or stock exchange listing after reviewing options this year.   
Chief executive officer Rob Gordon said the group was attracting domestic and international interest and would undertake a formal evaluation in coming months.   
AACo yesterday finished 7 lower at $2.98.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIA&apos;S biggest cattle owner yesterday lost its chief executive on speculation major shareholder Futuris had received a bid for its stake.   
Don Mackay yesterday resigned from Brisbane-based  Australian Agricultural Company with a short statement saying the move was amicable. ``The change to AACo management was initiated by the board in response to anticipated commercial opportunities and circumstances facing the company,&apos;&apos; the statement said.   
Neither Mr Mackay nor chairman Nick Burton Taylor were available for comment.   
Futuris, which holds a 43 per cent stake in AACo, announced in October it wanted to relinquish its stake and appointed  Citigroup and Caliburn Partners to find a buyer.   
At the time,  Macquarie Bank&apos;s new pastoral arm was touted as a possible buyer as were overseas commodities companies.   
Speculation in the market was that Futuris had received a bid for its stake, which would also trigger a full takeover offer for AACo as it is above the 19.9 per cent threshold.   
A Futuris spokesman did not return calls.   
Mr Burton Taylor will assume CEO&apos;s while a recruitment search goes on.   
AACo fell 10 per cent to $3.14 and Futuris fell 7c per cent to $2.15.

			<TEXT>GREG Norman, the Great White Shark, is selling great Australian beef to US restaurants and luxury food stores as part of a joint venture with  Australian Agricultural Co.
The venture&apos;s wares are showcased in a Los Angeles and New York supermarket promotion throughout January organised by Austrade, Tourism Australia and the Trade Department.   
More than 40 Australian food and wine producers will be showcased but it kicked off with a focus on two Queensland businesses -- the Greg Norman Australian Prime venture and OBE Beef.   
Pat Dempsey, manager of branded beef at AACo, Australia&apos;s largest cattle-farming business, said GNAP began US sample shipments in 2006, had steady initial interest and has seen a surge in the past six months.   
GNAP supplies the luxury Nobu restaurant and  Bristol Farms which has 15 high-end retail LA stores. GNAP is looking to sell into new markets.   
AACo controls nearly eight million hectares of cattle properties across Queensland and the Northern Territory.   
Mike McMahon,  Bristol Farms food buyer, says his customers are always impressed by the high quality of Australian products.

			<TEXT>The Australian Agricultural Co has reported a 30 per cent rise in net profitto almost $21 million in its first full year as a listed company. /Intr o
The Australian Agricultural Co has reported a 30 per cent rise in net profitto almost $21 million in its first full year as a listed company.
But it said earnings for 2002-03 would be 10 to 20 per cent lower because ofhigher operating costs, including supplemental feeding, grain and cattleexpenses, brought about by drought conditions.
Aust Ag is well placed for acquisitions, with gearing (net debt to totalequity) at 29.6 per cent. This rate could be described as &quot;lazy&quot;, chieffinancial officer Luisa Catanzaro said, but was a great foundation forgrowth.
Aust Ag&apos;s net profit after tax for the year to June 30 was $20.6 million, 30per cent higher than the normalised result from the year before. The companylisted on August 10 last year.
Earnings before interest and tax rose 12 per cent to $32.8 million as aresult of the increase in the value of its herds. Sales revenue increasedfrom $82 million to $94 million, while the size of the company&apos;s herd grew 5per cent to 407,000 head.
Average cattle prices were higher than those of the year before but theexecutive director of operations, Don Mackay, said prices had varied by 34per cent in the 12 months to June 30.
Operating cash flow before interest and tax grew by more than 45 per cent to$25.5 million despite higher grain prices and operating costs.
Dividend is a fully franked 6.08c a share, a yield of 8.1 per cent onyesterday&apos;s closing share price of 75c. Aust Ag also announced yesterday ithad bought 51 per cent of Rural Management Partners, which manages 60,000head of cattle on 16 properties on behalf of station owners and investors.The investment of $500,000 in RMP is expected to deliver management income,employing AustAg&apos;s skills in breed development and herd management.
Aust Ag chief executive Peter Holmes a Court said it had been a difficultyear.
The first recent case of BSE, or mad cow disease, in Japan had beenannounced on September 10. The US market was also affected by the impositionof beef quotas. Domestically, dry conditions, particularly in NSW, led tomany low-grade cattle being sold, knocking down record prices to awful lows.
Despite the challenges, AustAg finished within 2 per cent of its net profitprospectus target, Mr Holmes a Court said.
He also said the group&apos;s properties, spread between the Northern Territoryand Queensland, had good stocks of water and feed and were not affected bythe drought, which was occurring further south. Export conditions were alsoimproving, particularly in Korea and Japan.
The growth outlook was strong, he said, and Aust Ag&apos;s supply of beef to itsown brands Polkinghornes, Chefs Partner and the new &quot;1824&quot; brand, wouldprovide opportunities at home.
Other factors promoting growth were the low supply of quality cattle,recovery of the Japanese market, resolution of the US beef quota issue andrising cattle prices.
Net tangible assets were $1.03 on a deemed cost basis.

			<TEXT>Christine Lacy feels positively cramped.   
More salt into Peter Holmes a Court&apos;s wounds after his loss of Stanbroke Pastoral to Peter Hughes&apos;s Nebo consortium comes in confirmation of the cattleman&apos;s third place in the who&apos;s Australia&apos;s biggest landholder and beef producer contest.   
Number one, of course, is Stanbroke, with 11.7 million hectares. Australian Agricultural Co comes after the private Adelaide-based Kidman Holdings, Sir Stanley&apos;s kingdom, with 10.9 million ha.   
Poor old claustrophobic Holmes a Court&apos;s AACo has a mere 6.5 million ha but is Australia&apos;s second biggest maker of beef and beats his mum Janet&apos;s Heytesbury Beef.   
Her 3.3 million ha puts her in eighth place, with Heytesbury also the nation&apos;s fourth largest producer. Kerry Packer&apos;s Consolidated Pastoral, run by Ken Warriner, holds fifth place by size with interests spanning 5.2 million ha, and is also Australia&apos;s third-biggest beef producer.   
According to Australian Farm Journal&apos;s annual report on the sector, Colin Bell&apos;s Bell Securities is Australia&apos;s fifth biggest wool producer.   
Notably, the survey was sponsored by the versatile Rabobank, proving it&apos;s working things right up and down the spectrum.   
Reminds us of Justice Sackville&apos;s judgement on AACo&apos;s failed attempt to halt the sale of Stanbroke to Nebo, the coterie of which Hardly-Hungry-At-All Jack Cowin is a leading light.   
&quot;It was said that inferences should be drawn from Rabobank&apos;s dual role as financier to Nebo and adviser to AMP Henderson, and Mr Hughes&apos;s role as a director of Stanbroke and chairman of Nebo,&quot; Judge Sackville said.   
&quot;But the evidence shows that `Chinese walls&apos; were in place at Rabobank and, whatever the view one might have of Chinese walls in general, there is nothing to suggest that they were not maintained with due propriety.&quot;   
Peter&apos;s fair dinkum   
Peter Lehmann is no shrinking violet. The Barossa wine maker may be legging it across the northern hemisphere but it seems everywhere you turn, there he is.   
Lehmann&apos;s disdain for Philip Bowman&apos;s Allied Domecq and its takeover offer, in competition with the Hess Group of Switzerland, has even made the glorious pages of the Financial Times.   
The 73-year-old diplomatically spared the Poms his favourite cricket line &quot;The Australia-England Test will pale into insignificance with the battle that will emerge&quot; preferring instead to go with a simpler: &quot;War has been declared&quot;.   
The folk at the FT aren&apos;t the only ones talking to Lehmann.   
ASIC has sent the South Australian a cautionary letter after he publicly declared he was on no account selling his 10 per cent to Allied.   
The regulator helpfully suggested he might want to tone down his language because it meant he would wait for it be unable to sell his shares (little matter of &quot;truth in takeovers&quot;).   
It even provided a number Lehmann could ring (he&apos;s in Switzerland at the moment meeting his trout farming mates at Hess) if he wanted to work out a more ambiguous form of words.   
Lehmann did exactly that and told the ASIC operative who answered the phone that he meant what he said and the shares were staying put.   
Mac back at last   
It&apos;s been just over two years since MacBank took advantage of its giddy share price to raise $500 million with a placement at $35.   
And it took until the close of trade yesterday to reach that nose-bleed territory again, buoyed by the bank&apos;s latest pick-up in the UK water sector.   
The placement was being finalised just as the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks hit, which pulled the ladder out and MacBank went below $20 for a little while, a year ago.   
The bikkies were raised to help roll out a suite of infrastructure trusts although it&apos;s interesting Macquarie Airports Group was left off the bank&apos;s brag-list of offshore-domiciled funds outlined yesterday when detailing its latest purchase.   
Maybe the omission follows abandonment of plans to list MAG on a European exchange, amid continuing expectations that the unlisted Macquarie Airports Group is to be merged with the ASX-listed Macquarie Airports in the first half of next year.   
Kiddy-widdy report   
Early gong for best annual report must surely go to $125 million serviced office outfit Servcorp.   
In what is either a stunning display of naive art or the product of boss and major shareholder Alf Moufarrige&apos;s kindergarten recruitment program, page after page of the doco features child-like stick drawings of everyone from the board to employees around the globe.   
Amid the round, happy, smiley faces, our favourite was the long-haired, bearded bloke in robe and sunnies from Dubai.   
Chairman Bruce Corlett sports a crown and whistle; Moufarrige is on one side of a tennis net sporting a racquet and huge grin; while non-exec director Julia King also on the John Fairfax board is toasting the whole affair from the grandstand with a glass of bubbly. Dom Perignon, no less.   
Cutting up the garden   
So the subdivision of the Yates garden grinds on, with management finally selling the long-planted vegie seeds.   
So it came three or so weeks later than originally planned, for a price tag 20 per cent less than originally disclosed. Mere details.   
Still no word, though, on boss David Marginson and chairman and major investor Ross Norgard&apos;s deal to flog the forests.   
Marginson, who&apos;s getting sucked up the Orica shute anyway once it completes its purchase of the balance of Yates&apos;s business, told us in July a mob called Sustainable Forestry Management was buying his forestry assets for $14 million. That was to be done by August 15.   
Just a little while back that was finessed to $12.5 million, to be completed by September 25. Today is October 3 but there&apos;s still no word.

			<TEXT>Having failed to block the $490 million sale of AMP&apos;s Stanbroke Pastoral empire yesterday, Peter Holmes a Court&apos;s Australian Agricultural Co may push ahead with a damages claim for more than $100 million.   
Mr Holmes a Court confirmed a damages claim was in the works after Justice Ronald Sackville ended his dream to create Australia&apos;s largest cattle group by failing to grant an injunction against the transfer of Stanbroke to Nebo Holdings in the Federal Court yesterday.   
Nebo a syndicate of wealthy farmers led by Peter Hughes and backed by burger king Jack Cowin and potato baron Peter Menegazzo becomes the owner of Stanbroke&apos;s 11.7 million hectares and 500,000 head of cattle after a heated and occasionally personal legal stoush with AACo.   
&quot;AACo needs to accept they were beaten fairly in their bid for Stanbroke,&quot; Mr Menegazzo said. &quot;It is time for them to move on.&quot;   
During the hearing, AACo alleged Mr Hughes had colluded with AMP, a claim Justice Sackville said the group had &quot;retreated from&quot; after opening the case.   
On costs, Justice Sackville told AACo it had &quot;comprehensively lost&quot; its bid for an injunction despite allowing for the possibility AMP might have misrepresented parts of the tender process.   
In his judgement, Justice Sackville said AACo failed to prove &quot;misleading and deceptive conduct&quot; under the Trade Practices Act, adding that the evidence did not support Mr Holmes a Court&apos;s contention that AMP had not tried to achieve the best price for Australia&apos;s largest cattle group.   
He added it would be inappropriate to grant an interlocutory injunction which adversely affected the rights of Nebo, an &quot;innocent third party&quot;.   
AACo argued its bid was &quot;superior&quot; to Nebo&apos;s and alleged AMP Henderson director Marcus Derwin, who ran the tender process, favoured Mr Hughes because he planned to preserve Stanbroke as a separate entity.   
AACo, the country&apos;s second largest cattle group, hoped to merge its operations with Nebo.   
AACo barrister Jason Karas said two aspects to the damages claim one for the costs of the tender process of about $2 million and the other for lost opportunity would be considered.   
The second amount is believed to be around the $100 million mark. He would not comment.   
For its part, AMP claimed price rather than preserving Stanbroke was the overriding criteria, despite telling the public that keeping Stanbroke whole was a &quot;consideration&quot;.   
Mr Derwin had previously admitted the release was &quot;factually incorrect&quot;, an admission Justice Sackville said &quot;reflects little credit on AMP, since it means that a false statement was knowingly included in a media release in order to create a favourable impression&quot;.

			<TEXT>After three days of sometimes heated debate in the Federal Court, Peter Holmes a Court and Peter Hughes will have to wait until Tuesday for a decision on the immediate future of Stanbroke, AMP Life&apos;s vast cattle empire.   
Mr Holmes a Court&apos;s bovine concern, Australian Agricultural Company, is seeking an injunction to stop the $490 million sale of Stanbroke to Nebo Holdings, a syndicate of wealthy Queensland families led by Mr Hughes, and have the tender process reopened.   
Both men were once again in court on Friday to hear final submissions before Justice Ronald Sackville who will deliver his judgement at 2.15pm on Tuesday.   
Even if Justice Sackville finds in favour of Nebo, Stanbroke&apos;s owner (AMP Life) and manager (AMP Henderson) may face further legal action, with AACo considering a $100 million damages claim.   
AACo was the underbidder for the 11.7 million hectare Stanbroke property and claims its &quot;higher&quot; offer was ignored because it planned to merge its operations with Stanbroke&apos;s, rather than preserve it as separate entity.   
For its part, AMP argues that keeping the company together played no part in the decision-making process, despite having issued a press release claiming the preservation of Stanbroke was a consideration. AMP claims Nebo&apos;s was a superior bid.   
Nebo&apos;s barrister, John Sheahan, SC, argued that AMP was entitled to conclude &quot;Nebo&apos;s was the better deal&quot; based on a similar price and more favourable conditions to AMP, including a potentially quicker settlement.   
The matter ended in much the same way as it started, with a variety of extraordinary allegations from AACo&apos;s silk, Douglas Meagher, and vehement protests from AMP&apos;s Tom Bathurst, QC, and Mr Sheahan.   
Since Wednesday, Mr Meagher has accused AMP Henderson director Marcus Derwin, the man responsible for selling Stanbroke for AMP Life, of colluding with Mr Hughes both were directors of Stanbroke and misleading the public in the press release.   
Late Friday the Adelaide silk appeared to accuse Rabobank, which acted both as an adviser to AMP and Nebo, of breaching its &quot;Chinese walls&quot; but soon added the bank had done nothing improper.   
Mr Meagher&apos;s approach has been a source of frustration for Mr Bathurst and Mr Sheahan who once again argued that the serious allegations such as collusion were unfounded, not supported by AACo&apos;s evidence and should be withdrawn.   
Mr Sheahan argued AACo was &quot;looking through lenses&quot; which viewed &quot;all coincidences as conspiracy&quot; and &quot;all errors as fraud&quot;.   
Mr Sheahan went on to claim that AACo&apos;s allegations were done for the purposes of publicity and, in the case of Mr Meagher, not without precedent. Mr Meagher denied the allegations.

			<TEXT>&quot;We are left with what we started with, a case about a badly written press release.&quot;   
So opined John Sheahan, SC, as hostilities between Peter Holmes a Court&apos;s Australian Agricultural Co and AMP over the $490 million sale of the Stanbroke cattle empire resumed in the Federal Court yesterday.   
The press release in question was meant to put a good spin on the purchase of Stanbroke&apos;s 500,000 head of cattle by Nebo Holdings, a syndicate of wealthy families backed by Burger King Jack Cowin and represented in court by Mr Sheahan.   
&quot;A bit of a win for AMP and Stanbroke,&quot; AMP Henderson director Marcus Derwin explained to the court yesterday.   
But the press release sparked more juicy allegations by AACo silk Douglas Meagher, as well as embarrassing admissions by Mr Derwin that the release was &quot;factually incorrect&quot; and &quot;done for a media play&quot;.   
Mr Meagher seized on Mr Derwin&apos;s comments in the September 9 release, including: &quot;In making our final decision, many considerations were taken, including the final offer price and [Nebo&apos;s] intent to preserve [Stanbroke] as an ongoing concern.&quot;   
AACo, which is seeking an injunction to stop the sale being completed, not only claims its bid was at least $2.5 million higher (depending on adjustments) but that Nebo was favoured because it planned to &quot;preserve&quot; Stanbroke, a consideration Mr Holmes a Court was never told about.   
For its part, AMP has argued that the &quot;preservation&quot; of Stanbroke played no part its decision and that Nebo&apos;s bid was a similar price and contained less onerous conditions.   
Under cross-examination, Mr Derwin, who ran the sale process, gave a series of vague answers about the accuracy of the release and a draft statement prepared for the media, public and Stanbroke&apos;s owners (AMP Life policyholders).   
He eventually admitted the statement was &quot;probably factually incorrect&quot; and &quot;price, price and price&quot; was the most important factor.   
Asked by Mr Meagher if it was &quot;correct to lie to the public&quot;, Mr Derwin replied &quot;the words say what the words say&quot;.   
Mr Derwin admitted one of the aims of the press release was to reassure Stanbroke&apos;s 600 staff that their jobs were safe AACo had planned to merge Stanbroke&apos;s operations with its own and this was something &quot;the media likes to hear&quot;.   
Although Mr Derwin also admitted to helping draw up Nebo&apos;s final offer document on September 5, a bid he accepted later that day on behalf of AMP, he said the decision process was objective.   
Earlier, lawyers for Nebo and AMP expressed outrage over allegations of collusion that dominated Wednesday&apos;s proceedings.   
Referring to allegations &quot;imputing criminal conduct to Mr Derwin&quot;, Mr Sheahan said &quot;there was no foundation&quot; and called for an &quot;unequivocal apology&quot; from AACo.   
AMP&apos;s silk, Tom Bathurst, joined the fray, describing Mr Meagher&apos;s performance as &quot;conduct with the greatest respect [that] is neither becoming an apparently reputable public company nor certainly an experienced senior counsel&quot;.

			<TEXT>Finding Nebo was the easy part, it&apos;s selling Daisy that may be the problem.   
AMP Life now finds itself locking horns with Peter Holmes a Court&apos;s Australian Agricultural Company (AACo) before Justice Michael Moore in the Federal Court today over the sale of its Stanbroke pastoral empire.   
With the help of advisers Rabo-bank, AMP announced on September 9 the $490 million sale of Stanbroke to Nebo Holdings, a syndicate of wealthy families whose members include Burger King Jack Cowin and Swan Hill potato baron Peter Menegazzo.   
The announcement generated welcome publicity for the embattled AMP as well as Nebo, whose families now owned 11.7 million hectares of prime beef country not to mention 485,000 head of cattle.   
However, in a statement of claim filed yesterday, AACo said it offered to pay $541 million (including debt) for Stanbroke the day before the Nebo sale was announced and, three days earlier, had tabled a $501 million offer.   
On September 1, when bids were due to close, AACo had offered $491 million for Stanbroke.   
Not surprisingly, AACo, the country&apos;s third-largest cattle group, argues these offers appear to be higher than Nebo&apos;s winning bid.   
The court action is another problem to add to AMP&apos;s long list of woes and demonstrates how important the acquisition of Stanbroke, the county&apos;s largest landowner, was to AACo.   
Mr Holmes a Court, the son of the late 1980s corporate raider Robert, declared his interest in Stanbroke the moment it was put on the market in April and was considered a strong chance to consummate the &quot;company-making&quot; deal.   
Over several pages, AACo accuses of AMP Life and its manager, AMP Henderson, of &quot;breach of process contract&quot;, &quot;misleading and deceptive conduct&quot; and, worse still, not acting in the interests of AMP Life policy holders, the owners of Stanbroke.   
&quot;The respondents [AMP Henderson and AMP Life] acted upon considerations which did not advance the interests of owner and prospective owners of policies,&quot; the statement says.   
AACo goes on to question the way the tender process was conducted and argues the process &quot;unfairly precluded AACo from selection as the preferred purchaser of Stanbroke shares&quot;.   
As far as relief goes, AACo is applying for an injunction &quot;restraining AMP Life&quot; from transferring Stanbroke&apos;s assets to Nebo and requests that the second stage of the tender process be reinstated.   
Should this action fail, AACo has sought undisclosed damages for &quot;loss of opportunity to make profits&quot;.   
Although AACo&apos;s statement does not challenge the role played by Peter Hughes, who stepped down as a Stanbroke director during the sale process to drive the Nebo bid, it does point out that AMP failed to disclose the connection in its press release announcing the winning bid.   
The statement also mentions two early conversations between AACo director Chris Roberts and Andrew Mohl, a director of AMP Life, but makes no mention of an 11th hour call AACo is believed to have made to the AMP boss with an improved offer.   
An AMP spokesman confirmed that &quot;we have been served with an injunction&quot; and will be &quot;objecting to the injunction request vigorously&quot;.   
AACo shares finished the day 2c higher at $1.28.

			<TEXT>Australian Agricultural Co is likely to go it alone in its bid to take allof bigger rival Stanbroke Pastoral.
AACo is just one of several local cattle groups eyeing all or part of theAMP Life company.
Chief executive Peter Holmes a Court all but confirmed at yesterday&apos;sthird-quarter briefing that there could be a bid for Stanbroke&apos;s entire 11.7million hectare portfolio, saying the company had &quot;a large appetite&quot; and thesupport of major shareholder Futuris.
The AACo chief executive would not comment on the sale process but sourcesclose to the company said it would have no trouble raising the expected $300million to $500 million price tag.
The field lining up for Stanbroke include S Kidman &amp; Co, the Packer family&apos;sConsolidated Pastoral Co, Hughes Grazing Company and Greek shipping tycoonGregory Hadjieleftheriadis, who controls Alice Springs Pastoral Co.
Of these, Alice Springs and Hughes said they could mount an offer for all ofStanbroke&apos;s 27 stations in Queensland and the Northern Territory.
&quot;Yes we&apos;re interested in keeping Stanbroke as it is,&quot; said Alice Spring&apos;sgeneral manager David Warriner. &quot;We&apos;re talking to other like-minded partiesand, given our owners, when it comes to getting funding together anything ispossible.&quot;
Bidders for Stanbroke have a May 16 deadline to lodge expressions ofinterest. A short list will be determined a week later.
Greg Campbell, general manager of Australia&apos;s second largest landowner,Kidman, said he was &quot;sitting on the fence&quot;.
It is understood Kidman has discussed a proposal with acquisitive Queenslandfamilies such as the Actons and McDonalds but is not interested in biddingfor all of Stanbroke.
Consolidated Pastoral, which has stations in WA and the NT, did not returncalls but industry sources doubted whether James Packer shared his father&apos;sinterest in owning cattle.
While a consortium led by Stanbroke director Peter Hughes indicated it would&quot;probably&quot; lodge an expression of interest and did not rule out bidding forall of Stanbroke, observers questioned if it could fund a serious offer.
AMP gained full control of Stanbroke, which covers an area larger thanTasmania, in 1983, and announced that it was looking to sell out in earlyApril.
One concern is that AMP adviser Rabo, the local branch of the Dutch RabobankInternational, may attract a well-funded offshore buyer. &quot;Why else pay Raboto sell the thing,&quot; one local said. AACo said a strong cattle market meantnet profit for 2002-03 would be only 10 per cent below its previous recordof $20.6 million.
AACo had initially expected its 2002-03 net profit would be 10 to 20 percent below the previous year.

			<TEXT>Australia&apos;s third biggest cattle group, Australian Agricultural Co, has putits hand up to buy all the operations of its biggest rival, AMP Life&apos;sStanbroke Pastoral, in a sale that is certain to shake up the northAustralian cattle industry.
AMP Henderson, as manager of Stanbroke for AMP Life, yesterday opened atender to test what it described as &quot;significant interest&quot; for the prizedportfolio of cattle properties.
But AMP Henderson indicated that if bids fell short of expectations it wouldcontinue to run Stanbroke.
Stanbroke owns 27 cattle breeding and fattening stations across Queenslandand the Northern Territory, as well as beef processing operations.
AMP Henderson&apos;s head of unlisted investments, Marcus Derwin, said he wouldprefer to sell Stanbroke as a single unit rather than break it up.
Yet rural specialists believe some Queensland families may be sufficientlyflush with cash to bid for parts of Stanbroke&apos;s assets, a move that wouldstrengthen bidding tension.
Industry specialists said Stanbroke might fetch as much as $500 million butone noted that its herd numbers had dropped by 12 per cent during thedrought.
Other buyers could include the second biggest pastoral owner, S Kidman &amp; Co,which has properties adjoining Stanbroke spreads in the Channel Country ofsouth-west Queensland, and the Packer family&apos;s Consolidated Pastoral Co,which has stations in the north of Western Australia and the NT.
While AACo has fewer cattle and properties than Stanbroke, which runs about500,000 cattle on 11.7 million hectares, in many ways AACo mirrors its muchbigger rival. Both run cattle breeding, fattening and finishing operations,and each has developed retail brands.
AACo&apos;s chief executive, Peter Holmes a Court, yesterday said: &quot;We would lookat the terms of the tender and be very interested in the assets as they arequality assets. It is a well-run company, with good people, good cattle.&quot;
Kidman general manager John Campbell was typically reticent. &quot;If we do[bid], I can tell you it will be done very quietly,&quot; he said.
The head of the country&apos;s fourth biggest landowner, North AustralianPastoral Co&apos;s Nigel Alexander, also declined to comment.
Rural property agents believe AMP Life is selling Stanbroke when demand fortop-quality cattle properties is the strongest for two years and cattleprices are high.
John Burke, Wesfarmers Landmark&apos;s general manager in charge of ruralproperty for Queensland and the NT, said prices for Queensland cattleproperties had doubled in the past two years.
&quot;Anything with hoofs and horns gets a good price,&quot; Mr Burke said.
&quot;The whole demand has been around cattle. Anything with sheep, they gettaken off and replaced with cattle, so sheep numbers in Queensland are welldown.&quot;
At the same time, there has been a marked reversal in the agglomerationtrend of the past 40 years, when swathes of properties were collected by afew big corporations and superannuation funds.
Mr Burke and other industry specialists noted that most of the stations thathad changed hands in recent years had been bought by Queensland familiessuch as the Actons and McDonalds.

			<TEXT>The drought has savaged Australia&apos;s second-biggest cattle producer,Australian Agricultural Company, with net first half-year profit plummeting87 per cent to $3.7 million.
Earnings before interest and tax for the six months to December 31 fell 82per cent to $7.1 million compared with the corresponding period in 2001.However, operating cash flow fell only 26 per cent to $5.7 million.
AACo chief executive Peter Holmes a Court said that in 2002, revenuegenerated from the rising value of the company&apos;s cattle was $5 millioncompared with $43.8 million in 2001.
&quot;This was principally due to a lower cattle price appreciation in theperiod, up 4.7 per cent versus a 15.5 increase for the correspondingperiod,&quot; he said.
As at December 31, AACo&apos;s 393,000 cattle herd was valued at $194.9 million,reflecting an average value per head of cattle of $496. This was slightly upon the $466 average value as at June 30 last year but still well down fromthe $529 average as at December 31, 2001. Herd numbers fell 4 per cent from408,000 in 2001 but breeding herd numbers rose 3 per cent to 191,000 andcalving rates rose 2 per cent.
AACo&apos;s two feedlots had helped insulate the company from the worst of thedrought.
AACo reiterated that full year earnings would be 10 to 20 per cent below theprevious year&apos;s result of $20.6 million.
Mr Holmes a Court said its strong balance sheet gave it &quot;substantialacquisition capacity&quot;.
AACo&apos;s shares dropped 1c to 88c; no interim dividend.

Christine Lacy says there&apos;s nothing like buying dear and selling cheap.    
Multiplex boss Andrew Roberts, son of founder John, might owe insurance salesman Andrew Mohl a beer or two.    
After all, the minions at AMP Life seem to have saved the property developer at least a few million bucks.    
The sale of AMP Life&apos;s 16 per cent stake in takeover target Ronin to Multiplex, advised by UBS&apos;s Fergus Horribon, is starting to have a whiff of the controversial sale of the Stanbroke pastoral empire about it.    
In that deal, Stanbroke runner-up Australian Agricultural Co, then run by Peter Holmes a Court, cried foul over AMP&apos;s sale of the property portfolio to a rival bidder for what they claimed was a lesser price. The matter is still subject to court action.    
This time around, AMP Life is understood to have flogged its stake in Ronin, which is being helped by Citigroup&apos;s new recruit from Merrills, Simon Ranson, to the newly listed Multiplex for $1.33 a share including the September distribution.    
Word is, however, that Commonwealth Property Office Fund, who&apos;s hand is being held by Merrill&apos;s new face, Andrew Kerr, offered AMP more money for its Ronin stake but the fund managers didn&apos;t want to play with David Murray&apos;s team.    
As well as a deal based on price, AMP says it chose to sell to Multiplex because of other strong partnerships between the pair that could be built on the assets and the business. (Lawyers must have been all over that as a potential collateral benefit.)    
Further, it&apos;s believed Commonwealth&apos;s informal offer to Ronin was higher than that now on the table from Multiplex but, for their own reasons, not the least of which was that Multiplex now had its foot on AMP&apos;s Ronin stake, decided at the last minute to withdraw from the contest.    
Interestingly, there still remains no recommendation from the Ronin board, led by former corporate watchdog Alan Cameron, on the live Multiplex bid. Hoping for a little fresh price tension perhaps?    
Looting the trusts    
Who wouldn&apos;t be smiling in the listed property sector right now?    
Hit prediction is for a very festive season indeed as a precursor to bonus time after a year riding the industry&apos;s gravy train as deal fever took hold.    
Fattest calf came from the Lowys, who paid $95 million in advisory fees to a clutch of professional services outfits to get its three-way merger of the Westfield group off the ground.    
The deal was led by now JPMorgan investment banking boss Andrew Pridham while still at Grange Securities but completed at the US financial services giant after his surprise move there.    
The Deutsche three-way deal cost $40 million in fees, with UBS and the team led by banking boss Richard Hunt leading the way with the assistance of the MacBankers.    
UBS, with Fergus Horribon in the driver seat, is helping out Multiplex on its $1 billion-plus bid for Ronin; the Swiss broker also did the Multiplex float for the Roberts family.    
UBS is also trying to work out a way for Multiplex to get back into the battle to control UK developer Chelsfield, for which the Lowys have also bid $1.5 billion. A festive season, indeed.    
Ponce de Leon of Bondi    
The lifestyle of a non-executive director seems to be suiting former MacBanker Robin Crawford, who now chairs IT procurement and services company Volante.    
Don&apos;t know what sort of skin regime he&apos;s employing but associates are commenting that the Bathers Pavilion principal and partner to Eastern Suburbs-type Judy Joye (ex-wife of businessman Ian Joye) is looking a good 20-years younger these days.    
We went to the Volante annual report for a better idea on just how well the now 56-year-old is holding it together and indeed the photograph accompanying the chairman&apos;s report for the year does see the businessman staring out from a photo that could have been taken at least 15 years ago.    
Crawford, who is also on the investment committee of MacBank&apos;s direct investments division, is up for re-election to the Volante board at the next annual meeting. Judging by his youthful appearance in the annual report, he can offer a long-term vision.    
Stepdown to private    
New PowerTel boss Paul Broad will be hoping he&apos;s able to secure a better deal out of the telecom&apos;s board than was managed by his predecessor, Shane Allen.    
As the former head of EnergyAustralia, Broad, who until recently was also a non-executive director of Volante, last year looks to have managed a respectable $490,000 in return for his services, plus a handy $72,000-odd bonus payment.    
In the same year at PowerTel, Allen was paid a total package including bonus of about $577,000 for his efforts. So much for the private sector premium.

			<TEXT>Pastoralist Australian Agricultural Co has withstood a battering from drought and higher operating costs to post a 22 per cent lift in profit in the 12 months to June 30, with the promise of more to come.   
The Brisbane pastoral company, with earnings heavily reliant on movements in cattle prices, benefited from rising prices in the second half to record a net profit of $22.2 million.   
Just three months ago, the 180-year-old company warned that growth would be closer to 15 per cent following 18 months of dry conditions in rural Australia.   
AACo chief executive officer Don Mackay, who took over from high-profile chief executive and major shareholder Peter Holmes a Court earlier this year, said the rural icon was now well positioned to exploit new openings in world beef markets.   
&quot;We achieved a result in the top end of our forecast range despite the fact it was a difficult year,&quot; Mr Mackay said. &quot;We believe that we are moving out of what has been a seriously dry cycle and more normal conditions appear to be returning in most areas of Australia.&quot;   
Mr Mackay said he expected 2005 profit to be similar to the $22.2 million booked in 2003-04 but cash flow would be significantly higher.   
&quot;We believe in the next year we will see a consolidation of the current high cattle prices, rather than any significant increase,&quot; he said. &quot;World demand continues to grow and supply continues to fall, with herds in US and Australia at record low levels in most instances.&quot;   
He said AACo was was able to cash in on consumer demand for identifying the origin of beef products on supermarket shelves.   
Revenue jumped $42.7 million to $158.7 million, with a herd increase and higher cattle prices pushing SGARA (self generating and regenerating assets) revenue up 25 per cent to $134.3 million.   
AACo said offsetting increases in cattle revenues were higher operating costs, including $2.7 million in direct costs associated with the failed Stanbroke bid and its move to exit investments in retail beef ventures.   
Final dividend is a partially franked 6c, up from a fully franked 4c. AACo shares closed 2c higher at $1.33. The West Australian

			<TEXT>Higher operating expenditures translated into a lower nine-month profit for Australian Agricultural Co, the nation&apos;s second-largest beef cattle company. Nevertheless, the company forecasts its annual net profit will be 15 per cent higher than last year&apos;s $18.3 million, if trading conditions hold.   
Beef sales revenues were up $10.7 million over the previous corresponding period, but drought-related expenses such as higher grain costs and write-offs from discontinued operations hit the Queensland company&apos;s bottom line.   
&quot;I thought it was a solid result, given mixed trading conditions during the third quarter,&quot; ABN Amro analyst Sophie Mitchell said.   
Third-quarter revenue was boosted by strong cattle prices and Japanese and Korean bans on US beef following the North American mad cow disease outbreak.   
&quot;The principal driver of change in recent months has been exports,&quot; chief executive officer Don Mackay said. Profit forecasts are contingent on beef prices remaining high due to the Asian ban on US imports.   
AACo expects to pay a 6c dividend in November, but is reverting to an annual single dividend payment cycle &quot;in order to better reflect the nature and cashflow cycle of the business&quot;. The company paid two dividends last year 2c in June and 4c in November.   
&quot;I wasn&apos;t expecting [the dividend change],&quot; Ms Mitchell from ABN Amro said, &quot;but I wasn&apos;t concerned.&quot;   
Three one-off expenses were included in yesterday&apos;s results. The company closed its Sydney head office, resulting in the January resignation of CEO Peter Holmes a Court, who declined to relocate to Brisbane. He remained as a non-executive director but resigned in March.   
AACo also left its Polkinghornes butcher business and incurred costs with its failed Stanbroke Pastoral Co tender.   
But the $3.9 million total write-offs have not affected the long-term viability of the 180-year-old company, one of Australia&apos;s oldest continuously operating businesses.   
Mr Mackay said there was &quot;no doubt&quot; that the recent popularity of high-protein diets, such as the Atkins diet, had aided sales.   
Shares closed up 2c at $1.20 yesterday, the highest since March 8.

			<TEXT>One of Australia&apos;s largest cattle companies, Australian Agricultural Co, is pinning its hopes of a solid full-year result on positive currency movements and strengthening stock prices after reporting an interim loss.   
AACo, which replaced its chief executive, Peter Holmes a Court, earlier this year, announced a $2.9 million net loss for the six months to December 31, after costs associated with the drought and its failed bid for AMP&apos;s Stanbroke Pastoral empire.   
The first half result was well down on the $3.8 million net profit for the previous year but new chief executive Don Mackay said the group&apos;s full year earnings guidance remained unchanged, with the earnings expected to be 15-25 per cent above the 2003 net profit of $18.3 million.   
&quot;We are confident that our cost base will return to more normal levels as the impact of the drought recedes,&quot; Mr Mackay said. &quot;Likewise we anticipate good cattle prices over the coming six months which will provide higher cash returns.&quot;   
Heavy rain across AACo&apos;s properties in Queensland and the Northern Territory are expected to reduce feed costs while an outbreak of mad cow disease in the United States had seen cattle export prices to Japan and Korea rise by more than 10 per cent in January and there were hopes of more to come.   
In a note to clients, Goldman Sachs said AACo could hit its forecasts but pointed out the group was &quot;reliant on current price trends continuing (reflecting Asian bans on US beef remaining in the short term) and no further significant appreciation in the Australian dollar&quot;.   
Despite expectations of a better second half, the market was unimpressed, sending the shares 4c lower to $1.28.   
The first half result included a pre-tax write-off of $2.5 million relating to the failed Stanbroke bid, which is still the subject of court action, and $900,000 for its aborted Polkinghornes butchery shop venture.   
While Mr Mackay does not expect this week&apos;s trade agreement with the US to have a &quot;significant&quot; effect on AACo, the discovery of mad cow disease has almost put an end to US beef exports.   
&quot;This trend is expected to continue in the short term and, as such, AACo is forward selling grain-fed cattle to capitalise on the strong prices seen at present,&quot; the company said.   
AACo said it would provide detail of any interim dividend in the final quarter of the financial year.   
Last year AACo announced on in May that an interim dividend of 2c per share would be paid and Goldman Sachs is expecting a similar amount this time.

			<TEXT>Peter Holmes a Court cited family reasons for his resignation as head of Australia&apos;s main beef production company but the reality appears to be a little more complex.   
James Chessell talks to him about the big changes he tried to make.   
Last week, when Peter Holmes a Court surprised and puzzled many people by resigning as chief executive of the country&apos;s oldest pastoral empire, he was not at home in Sydney but at his mother&apos;s Heytesbury Stud near Keysbrook, about half an hour&apos;s drive south of Perth.   
The property had been the site of years of Holmes a Court corporate scheming, and it was here that Peter&apos;s famous father, Robert, briefly Australia&apos;s richest man, retreated during the 1980s. So it seemed appropriate the latest example of the family&apos;s ambition would end among Heytesbury&apos;s white fences and horses.   
Holmes a Court spent much of the hot West Australian afternoon explaining to journalists that after a review by Australian Agricultural Co&apos;s board, the 180-year-old beef concern was moving its head office from Sydney to Brisbane and that he and his family would not be following.   
Don Mackay, a Dubbo-born cattleman, whose lack of Holmes a Court polish is made up for by almost 30 years&apos; experience in the pastoral industry, would be the new chief.   
The public reasons given for the change Holmes a Court stepped aside because he did not want to uproot his young family have been largely accepted by the sharemarket and the media. But some have questioned the spin.   
Senior AACo sources have told the Herald that investors and sections of the board lost faith in Holmes a Court&apos;s ambitious plans to turn AACo into a global &quot;paddock to plate&quot; food company that owned pie shops as well as cattle stations.   
There are also suggestions Holmes a Court&apos;s high profile, outspokenness and the failure to acquire AMP&apos;s Stanbroke Pastoral group last year worked against him.   
These allegations are strongly denied by AACo&apos;s chairman, Nick Burton Taylor , AACo&apos;s largest shareholder, Futuris, and Holmes a Court, who points to his record of healthy shareholder returns during one of the worst droughts in recent memory.   
&quot;Managing is not a popularity contest,&quot; he says. &quot;People suggest I am the kind of person who makes friends easily but I make the same amount of friends as enemies in what I do.   
&quot;I have a profile because I have a funny last name; some people are going to give me a shot and some people are going to tear strips off me and never give me fair chance. Big deal. I learnt to live with it when I was 12.&quot;   
After leaving Australia a week after he finished school, Holmes a Court eventually settled in New York where he worked as a financial analyst and a theatre producer, promoting the likes of Jerry Seinfeld and Tap Dogs.   
In 2000 he sold the production company and his 16 per cent in the Holmes a Court&apos;s family company, Heytesbury Pty Ltd, for a reported $30 million, severing all business ties with his mother. &quot;Family relationships are always better when they&apos;re not intertwined with business,&quot; he says.   
Soon after, Peter became the first of Robert and Janet Holmes a Court&apos;s four children to accept a public profile when he returned to Sydney after 15 years abroad to run AACo, a soon-to-be-floated, out-of-fashion rural company with 380,000 head of cattle and land holdings the size of Tasmania.   
His connection was Futuris&apos;s then boss, Alan Newman, one of his father&apos;s closest lieutenants in the &apos;80s, who needed the charismatic 32-year-old to help sell the float to a sharemarket wary of agricultural offerings.   
With little in the way of animal husbandry experience, Holmes a Court boldly declared he would change the way AACo did business and more than double its herd size to more than a million head of cattle.   
Despite a rocky debut, the float was well received. Russell Crowe, the actor and self-described cattle man, whom Holmes a Court met at a Los Angeles party, even bought shares.   
Holmes a Court soon became regular fodder for gossip columns: attending Crowe&apos;s wedding; entertaining Rudy Giuliani at a Bowral barbecue in August; celebrating his 35th birthday at a black-tie party with the likes of David and Skye Leckie and John and Lucy Brogden.   
&quot;I find Peter and his wife Divonne a lot of fun,&quot; says Leckie. &quot;I reckon he&apos;s got great charm. I reckon he&apos;ll go places&quot;.   
Holmes a Court and his US-born wife have 4 1/2-year-old twin boys, George and Robert, and two-month-old twin girls, Elsa and Madison. They are in the middle of renovating a $4 million Centennial Park home. It is for these family reasons Holmes a Court says he didn&apos;t think for long about knocking back a move to Brisbane. &quot;Some of the articles written after this decision said I chose lifestyle over a job. I hope someone will give me another demanding job. I just chose not to uproot my family.&quot;   
Holmes a Court plans to take February off and has employed a small advisory firm, Nitor Private, to field job offers. He plans to stay as a non-executive director and keep his 8 per cent shareholding in AACo.   
But it is what Holmes a Court did at his first chance to earn his corporate stripes that has observers talking this week. At the centre of this is the &quot;paddock to plate&quot; strategy, which is a way of diversifying the company&apos;s earnings away from the sale of cattle, which are susceptible to lower prices and higher feed costs in times of drought.   
These &quot;value added&quot; operations, such as pie shops, beef stores and specialist cuts of beef under its 1824 brand, accounted for less than 1 per cent of AACo&apos;s turnover before the float, around 10 per cent presently and, according to a Holmes a Court prediction on the ABC in August 2002, would reach 50 per cent in three years.   
It is, however, not a universally admired strategy and AACo is no longer interested in the 50 per cent target.   
&quot;Retailing is very much a specialist business; the role of AACo is manufacturing,&quot; says John Carter, the chairman of the Australian Beef Association for the past six years. &quot;Only a small percentage [less than 20 per cent] of your beast is going to feature in a restaurant,&quot; he says. &quot;The vast majority goes into mince meat and the like it&apos;s very easy to lose perspective on those few cuts of meat.&quot;   
It is these types of comments that have dogged Holmes a Court. &quot;We set out to take the company outside an area it was familiar with in a very modern way,&quot; he says. &quot;Was everything we did successful? No. But if we were petrified of failure we would never have done some of the things that turned out to be fantastic.   
&quot;We did not spend a lot of money on this stuff and I stand by the large amount of wealth we have created for our shareholders.&quot;   
But the criticism comes from within the company as well. An AACo source says directors were concerned the chief executive was too busy worrying about peripheral matters, leaving the Brisbane-based Mackay to managed the stations.   
AACo&apos;s largest shareholder, however, does not agree. &quot;We have clearly said the operational performance at AACo needed to be improved,&quot; says Futuris&apos;s boss, Les Wozniczka . &quot;What you shouldn&apos;t do is read into that there was underperformance by Peter.&quot;   
Wozniczka says that while &quot;some of the value-added stuff has worked and some hasn&apos;t&quot; he thinks &quot;Peter did an excellent job during the float and AACo has basically met its earnings forecasts and paid its dividends&quot;.   
&quot;We talked about [Peter] commuting [to Brisbane] but . . . you can&apos;t have a CEO on the hill and troops in the valley.&quot;   
Operational issues are said to be the main source of any friction at AACo but missing out on a chance to buy its bigger rival, Stanbroke, has not helped.   
AMP sold Stanbroke to a company called Nebo for $490 million last year, even though AACo offered slightly more money. AMP says Nebo&apos;s was a better, more certain offer, while AACo has alleged in court action that the sale process was an &quot;inside job&quot;.   
There is, however, a feeling, shared by some in the AACo and AMP camps, that the seller believed Holmes a Court was the source of a series of press leaks during the tender process.   
Holmes a Court says this argument misses the point. &quot;Whether I am annoying, West Australian, had the wrong skin colour, had the wrong religion, they [AMP] had an absolute obligation to sell for the highest price to benefit its policy holders. I feel very comfortable that I stuck to the terms of the confidentiality agreement.&quot;   
After Holmes a Court&apos;s resignation, Burton Taylor and Mackay gave interviews emphasising that AACo would be concentrating on the business of breeding, raising and selling cattle.   
But both stress this is not a reaction to Holmes a Court&apos;s tenure. If there was a falling out, Burton Taylor asks, why would the former chief take up a non-executive director&apos;s position on the board and keep his shares?   
&quot;Will there be a change of emphasis in the business? The answer is probably yes,&quot; says Mackay. &quot;But we won&apos;t pull back on some aspects of the previous strategy.&quot;   
As an example, Mackay said AACo will continue to expand the 1824 beef brand, one of the innovations Holmes a Court personally came up with. &quot;He&apos;s a very decent fellow, a very straight shooter,&quot; says Mackay. &quot;Peter and I began this journey three-odd years ago. It has been an extraordinary journey.&quot;

			<TEXT>When the board of Australian Agricultural Co, one of the country&apos;s oldest and largest cattle empires, decided to move head office from Sydney closer to the action in Brisbane, its members knew their chief executive, Peter Holmes a Court, wouldn&apos;t be packing his bags.   
The Oxford-educated son of one Australia&apos;s most enigmatic businessmen returned from producing shows in New York to run AACo before its stock-market debut in August 2001, but another move was out of the question.   
&quot;It&apos;s not a decision I take lightly,&quot; he said yesterday after AACo announced he would step down from the helm of the 180-year-old business in favour of Don Mackay, until now executive director of operations. &quot;But I have a young family, Sydney is where I&apos;ve made my life and Sydney is where we live.&quot;   
Indeed, Mr Holmes a Court seems to have settled into Sydney life quite nicely.   
Just before Christmas, about the time he learned of the AACo board&apos;s plans, Mr Holmes a Court and his wife Divonne held a black-tie party at their Darling Point residence attended by the likes of John and Lucy Brogden, David and Skye Leckie, Jeremy Ingall, and Nicole and Peter Hines.   
The occasion was his 35th birthday, Divonne becoming an Australian citizen and the birth of a second set of twins, Elsa and Madison.   
The couple are in the process of moving to Centennial Park to better accommodate sons George and Robert, 4 1/2.   
AACo&apos;s chairman, Nick Burton Taylor, said the decision to move stemmed from &quot;a strategic review&quot; to get the head office closer to the company&apos;s 6.5 million hectares and 400,000 head of cattle in Queensland and the Northern Territory.   
&quot;As the review progressed we realised `Oh golly, there&apos;s a human cost to this&apos;, but it was a decision we had to make,&quot; he said. &quot;We needed to be clear to the troops that we wanted to keep everyone in the same trench.&quot;   
While the timing of the announcement seems curious to some AACo&apos;s future could not be brighter thanks to favourable weather, an outbreak of mad cow disease in the US opening up Asian markets and troubles at its competitor Stanbroke Pastoral Mr Holmes a Court insists he understands the board&apos;s reasons.   
&quot;It&apos;s a good time to leave,&quot; he said. &quot;If they [the board] believe the relocation is the best thing then its the best thing.&quot;   
Mr Holmes a Court and Mr Taylor played down suggestions there had been a falling out. Mr Holmes a Court, AACo&apos;s second-largest shareholder, will remain on the board &quot;for as long as they want me&quot; and has no intention to sell his stock.   
As for the future, Mr Holmes a Court says he &quot;has plenty of years left in me&quot;. Public company life, rather than producing, seems to be preference. &quot;Without being unduly rude to people in the entertainment industry, I think I&apos;ve enjoyed working for [a] public company more.&quot;

			<TEXT>Australia&apos;s second biggest beef producer, Australian Agricultural Company, has spent $50 million to buy 58,000 head of cattle and a Queensland property.   
The acquisition will boost AACo&apos;s breeding herd by 19 per cent to 190,000 breeding females and bring its total herd to about 460,000 head.   
It is also expected to generate extra operating cash flow, before interest and tax, of $4.5 million in its first full year of operation. The $50 million deal will be funded by term-debt.   
The market liked the news, with AACo&apos;s shares rising 4c yesterday to $1.26.   
The Carrum Station property, of 50,613 hectares, has a carrying capacity of about 8000 cattle and adjoins the road and rail links at Julia Creek in north-west Queensland.   
The 58,000 cattle, a Brahman and a Brahman-cross breeding herd, will be run on Carrum Station, AACo&apos;s existing properties and Lawn Hill Station under an agistment arrangement.   
Lawn Hill, a 467,045ha property near the Gulf of Carpentaria, has a carrying capacity of 40,000 cattle. It adjoins AACo&apos;s Gregory Downs station and will be run under the agistment deal as a breeding station.   
Carrum will become part of AACo&apos;s production system, receiving young cattle from the company&apos;s properties in the Barkly Tablelands to grow until they reach feedlot entry weight.   
These cattle will then enter AACo&apos;s two feedlots at Goonoo, in central Queensland, and Aronui, in south Queensland.   
The expanded breeding herd will lift AACo&apos;s calf production from 115,000 to about 135,000 a year.   
The chief executive, Peter Holmes a Court, said Carrum would improve AACo&apos;s production system. &quot;By taking more young cattle off AACo&apos;s breeding stations and growing them on Carrum, the breeding stations will be able to carry more breeding cows, which will result in more calves produced,&quot; he said. &quot;It will also shorten the time required to bring young cattle to market.&quot; Mr Holmes a Court said the efficiency gains in AACo&apos;s production system would be worth $1 million a year within two years.   
AACo&apos;s shares have risen substantially in the past two weeks since the US reported its first suspected case of mad cow disease. AACo, a big beef exporter, is expected to pick up any slack as US beef exports are hit.   
The new acquisition also overcomes some of the disappointment from AACo&apos;s failure last year to buy AMP&apos;s Stanbroke cattle property, which was sold for $490 million to Nebo Holdings, a syndicate of Queensland families.   
AACo posted a net profit of $18.3 million for 2002-03, down from $20.6 million in the previous year but in line with market expectations.   
The company expects net profit to rise 15-25 per cent in 2003-04, thanks to greater sales of cattle and higher prices.

Not the best time to be working on a float. The market&apos;s on the ropes. Everyone&apos;s long cash. Share prices have been cast asunder. Healthy correction at best. You know the drill.    
Worse still, Phil Green&apos;s Babcock &amp; Brown stake is off $62 million in a week. They&apos;re worth a mere $208 million at yesterday&apos;s prices. David Clarke&apos;s Macquarie Bank shares will cost you a piddling $64 million. Last week they were pushing $75 million. Grim times indeed. Never mind. It&apos;ll be back up again next week.    
Which brings us to the ever-busy House of UBS. There&apos;s companies to be listed. Several.    
Singapore Power is taking on Cheung Kong Infrastructure in the ding-dong battle of the Asian utility heavyweights. UBS&apos;s Richard Hunt and Andrew Stevens are in the SingPower corner. Morgan Stanley&apos;s Marcus Fanning may have lucked out with Frightening in the Turnbull Stakes on the weekend but he&apos;s got a gig too.    
CKI is relying on the talents of Hamish Douglass at Deutsche.    
Then there&apos;s UBS operative Shane Doyle doing the $100 million insurance float, Austbrokers, for ING.    
And let&apos;s not forget the Swiss bankers have David &quot;the Cat&quot; di Pilla and Daniel Kleijn beavering away on the Crown Castle mobile phone tower offering (read sale to Macquarie Bank).    
One deal UBS hasn&apos;t been able to get its hands on is the Burns Philp spin-off Goodman Fielder. Credit Suisse First Boston&apos;s Rob Stewart and Adam Lennen - whose aptly-named Demerger also finished behind Makybe Diva in the Turnbull - are advising Burns Philp saviour Graeme Hart. No doubt it will get away. There&apos;s nothing like the market&apos;s breather to make them earn their fees.    
Long trip for lunch    
About 400 rock kickers were treated to a speech from Derek Pannell, head of Canadian mining house Falconbridge, at a Melbourne Mining Club bash yesterday. The guest of honour earned extra points for just showing up. Two weeks after the invitation was extended, Falconbridge joined the long list of companies to be raided by Xstrata boss Mick Davis.    
So while Pannell could have been forgiven for staying at home, he arrived at Tullamarine at 9.30 yesterday morning, only to be on the first plane back to Toronto at 4.30pm.    
Pannell shared the head table with two former WMC chiefs, Sir Arvi Parbo and Hugh Morgan, fresh from keeping interest rates steady at his Reserve Bank gig earlier this week.    
Pannell was no doubt hoping some of the supposedly Australian miners with offices in Melbourne might be listening. History tells us BHP beat Xstrata with a knock-out bid for WMC. But it was a case of enjoy it while you can for the Big Pom&apos;s employees yesterday. Its clean-living Texan boss, &quot;Young&quot; Chip Goodyear, is about to introduce a no grog-at-work policy at its head office.    
WMC had the same policy (as miners aren&apos;t allowed to drink on the job). Anyway, no prizes for guessing a chap from BHP treasury department won a bottle of wine in the raffle.    
Just two cowboys    
Peter Holmes a Court may have left cowboy concern Australian Agricultural Co more than a year ago but he hasn&apos;t lost his passion for beef. The former AACo boss and his actor mate Russell Crowe have a few common interests, including a continuing look at the Rabbitohs and a film and music project in East Sydney. But probably the least known is they both run cattle: Holmes a Court at his farm somewhere west of Sydney and Crowe at his Nana Glen property near Coffs Harbour.    
They&apos;re obviously doing something right as Rusty&apos;s beef is being served up this month at Kingsleys steak house at the Woolloomooloo wharf. Half the proceeds go to the Australian Children&apos;s Music Foundation, Crowe father-in-law Don Spencer&apos;s musical charity for disadvantaged kids.    
Miner&apos;s retreat    
Some chief executives can&apos;t get enough of corporate disclosure. The boss of chromite concern Consolidated Minerals, Michael Kiernan, has bought a $4 million-plus love nest to share with his new wife. We know this because Kiernan declared in an ASX announcement that he&apos;d sold 1 million shares to purchase an apartment. We hope it goes well for them.    
Kiernan was once asked if he had any near-death experiences getting Cons Mins&apos; Woodie Woodie manganese deposit up and running. The answer was no. The closest was &quot;receiving a Dear John letter from my [now ex-] wife&apos;s solicitor&quot;.    
Keystone controllers    
Thank goodness for APRA, that most speedy of prudential regulators. Four and a half years after HIH collapsed in a screaming heap and APRA has publicly opined: &quot;[former HIH chairman Geoffrey] Cohen failed on a number of occasions to ensure that all relevant matters and materials were properly brought before the HIH board&quot;.    
Royal Commissioner Neville Owen concluded Cohen was &quot;an ineffective chairman&quot; two years after HIH&apos;s demise, which left some observers pondering what APRA&apos;s been pondering all this time. They&apos;re lucky Cohen&apos;s still about to receive a slap from their limp lettuce leaf.    
The lad&apos;s no lark    
Say what you like about the dismal scientists but they do a good line in self-deprecation. Take, for example, the House of Amro. No sooner had Gerard Minack left for Morgan Stanley than his gloomy musings were replaced with another harbinger of doom, Robert Lind.    
&quot;You might have noticed that I have a tendency to pessimism,&quot; he noted yesterday. &quot;As a Yorkshireman, gloominess is part of my genetic code. My training in economics merely adds another layer of despondency. In my case, nurture has reinforced my natural personality traits.    
&quot;Some are not so lucky. Take two other members of the economics team here at ABN. One of them (half Italian) always wants to look on the bright side. Things are never as bad as they seem. Then, there is another team member who cheerfully insists we are about to see the end of the world as we know it. In both cases, a fundamentally more cheerful persona offsets the pessimism ingrained through a career as an economist.&quot;    
Mere youngsters    
Congratulations to Judy Lowy (wife of Steven and Watto Bay renovation enthusiast), who celebrated her 40th at the Capitol Theatre at the long weekend.    
And congratulations to Ian &quot;Smithy&quot; Smith (husband of Natasha Stott Despoja and Gavin Anderson PR enthusiast), who celebrated his 40th with a few close friends at his Adelaide home at the long weekend.

			<TEXT>Cattle company Australian Agricultural Co is tipping a strong profit this year provided good rains continue and beef prices remain high.  
The chief executive, Don Mackay, said the late June rain would assist recovery in the second half of the year. &quot;If cattle prices remain at present levels ... we should meet market expectations on profit,&quot; he said.  
Mr Mackay declined to nominate a figure but some analysts have tipped a full-year profit of about $28 million. First-half profit was $6.7 million, a 51 per cent rise on the December half.  
AACo&apos;s financial year now ends on December 31. This is the end of its main sales and operating cycle and better reflects the seasonal nature of its business.  
Mr Mackay said world demand for beef remained strong but could fluctuate because of high prices. However, the world supply of quality beef remained limited.  
&quot;We will strive to satisfy customer demand for traceable, quality assured and source-verified products,&quot; he said.  
Mr Mackay said forward purchases of grain ensured that feed costs would remain at low levels for the rest of the year.  
The company&apos;s budget for this year is based on the Australian dollar staying between US74c and US78c.  
Mr Mackay said the US would struggle to re-enter the Japanese market. US domestic demand was strong, so its producers would concentrate on that.  
Also, the US did not have the traceability and age-verification systems Australia had.  
This would make it hard for the US to meet the strict age and slaughter conditions Japan had put on it to resume beef trade.  
&quot;That will restrict their capacity to compete with us,&quot; Mr Mackay said. He expects US beef sales to Japan to resume after Christmas.  
Canada was an emerging threat to Australia&apos;s North Asian markets, Mr Mackay said.  
It was putting in place similar quality assurance measures to Australia but was also likely to focus on the US market.  
AACo&apos;s revenue rose 7 per cent to $85.6 million in the June half, when rainfall was 31 per cent down on the average.  
Only good December and June rains had got the company through the tough dry spell, Mr Mackay said. AACo bought 5000 fewer cattle and held back 15,000 head from sale because of the lower prices earlier in the year.  
The company declared a 7c dividend, up 17 per cent on last year, franked to 20 per cent.  
It will be paid on October 14 for shareholders registered on September 22. AACo shares rose $1.78 to 1.5c.

			<TEXT>Cattle families are challenging corporations as movers and shakers in Australia&apos;s surging beef industry, research shows.  
Large and efficient operations, whether private or corporate, are increasingly driving the industry&apos;s future.  
Family companies make up 55 per cent of the land holdings of the top 10 per cent of beef producers, says Rural Management Partners, a management and investment company owned by Australian Agricultural Company.  
RMP&apos;s managing director, Chris Evans, said almost 30 families had vaulted themselves into the ranks of large-scale corporate cattle producers with the sale and dispersal of AMP&apos;s Stanbroke Pastoral Co.  
Of the 19 Stanbroke properties sold last year, 18 were bought by family companies.  
&quot;We&apos;ve seen 10 or more families pursuing cattle properties for values of between $20 and $50 million. This has never happened before,&quot; he said.  
Mr Evans said these families owned more than 30 million hectares of land across Western Australia, Northern Territory and Queensland.  
Five were in the top 10 beef cattle producers and competed with big companies such as AACo, Stanbroke and NAPCO.  
&quot;Some families have aggregated properties capable of running 100,000 or 150,000 head of cattle, representing businesses of more than $150 million,&quot; Mr Evans said at the launch of RMP&apos;s beef industry outlook study.  
Large family businesses were run on corporate lines, spreading overheads, and some marketed their own products to retailers.

Cattle and share prices are high and drought is likely, so why not raise some cash?  
Beef producer Australian Agricultural Company is preparing a $66.7 million capital raising through a 1-for-5 entitlements offer through ABN Amro.  
The offer, representing 18 per cent of AACo&apos;s market capitalisation and some 40 million shares, will be pitched at shareholders in coming weeks priced at $1.65 against a &quot;current price&quot; of $1.87. AACo closed 6c down at $1.82 yesterday.  
Major shareholder Futuris is understood to be subscribing for $30 million of stock, in line with its 44.2 per cent stake.  
The funds will be used to repay debt.  
Foodland fairy tales  
There&apos;s speculation about a spoiler bid in the Metcash-Foodland tussle. One possibility is a full cash offer from Woolworths for Foodland&apos;s Australian and Kiwi operations, backed by an agreement that Metcash would buy the Australian wholesale business and some of the Australian supermarkets.  
Woolworths would be happy to add some of Foodland&apos;s WA supermarkets to its chain. It commands 28 per cent of the WA market - its weakest position in any state - compared with Coles&apos;s 33 per cent.  
Such a deal needs to pass muster with the competition regulators and Metcash.  
If Metcash isn&apos;t interested, Franklins, controlled by South Africa&apos;s Pick &apos;n Pay, might be a willing partner. Chief executive Aubrey Zelinksy says he&apos;s got enough on his hands but with only 77 NSW stores a chance to expand outside the state might prove too good to resist.  
The final hurdle for Woolworths would be whether to offer a premium on Foodland&apos;s share price, which rose another 9c to $24.80 yesterday.  
That might hinge on whether it could save on the NZ division&apos;s operating efficiencies and cut better deals with suppliers.  
Affinity cashing in  
Privately held hospital operator Affinity Health confirmed it&apos;s preparing to list, appointing Citigroup and UBS to advise.  
Affinity bought 53 hospitals from Mayne Group in 2003 for $813 million and is understood to be seeking up to $1.5 billion from a June float.  
Affinity will redeem 1.5 million of debt securities for $106 each, sold to investors in April last year for $100.  
Selling Telstra on net  
The Government could sell its 51.8 per cent Telstra stake in a Google-style internet share auction. The Department of Finance has issued a request for tender to examine the proposal. It&apos;s believed this is separate to the scoping study into T3 as the investment banks might not favour a proposal that could slash their fees.  
Royal whodunnit  
A touch of intrigue surrounded the sale of nearly $300 million worth of Macquarie Bank shares late Tuesday with even the Sultan of Brunei rating a mention.  
Macquarie Equities moved a line of 6 million shares or 2.6 per cent of the bank at $49.  
The most likely scenario appears a local institution selling to a local insto.  
Current major institutions are Barclays and Colonial but with Barclays considered an index manager, the smart money was on Colonial being the seller.  
Smaller fundies were miffed the parcel wasn&apos;t offered around.  
Virgin Blue blows it  
The stream of upbeat news releases and last week&apos;s bullish target statement doesn&apos;t appear to be firing up Virgin Blue.  
The airline&apos;s shares fell as low as $1.97, their lowest point since Patrick Corp launched its $1.90 a share takeover bid for the airline.  
Investors appeared to ignore the announcement of the start of a &quot;high value incentive program&quot; to attract small business passengers. The announcement comes just days after Virgin declared it was getting &quot;serious about business travel&quot; with its creation of a Blue Plus fare, which will include priority check-in, free lounge, etc.  
Given concerns about Virgin&apos;s yields in the wake of two recent profit downgrades, the market appears sceptical about the airline&apos;s latest attempts to go after higher yielding business passengers. Virgin probably won&apos;t be taken too seriously until it sets up a frequent flyer program.  
Investors don&apos;t appear to be taking the release of last week&apos;s target statement, which valued the airline between $2.43 to $2.90, too seriously either. In the 10 days since the statement was released to the market Virgin shares have fallen 6c to $1.98.  
Money on the wharves  
Virgin&apos;s 46 per cent owner Patrick Corp is in the unique spot of talking down the value of an airline that is already weighing down its own share price. After having its nose bloodied by two Virgin profit downgrades, Patrick shares were lifted on signs of good news from its mainstay stevedoring operations.  
Shares in Patrick rose 11c to $6.17 after its main competitor, P&amp;O Ports, reported a 52 per cent lift in profits for its Australian operations to &#194;&#163;&#194;&#163;26.9 ($65 million) for the December half. With P&amp;O Ports reporting improved productivity in its Sydney and Melbourne operations, the result underlined cargo volumes are showing little sign of slowing.  
Sir Ron cleans up  
Shareholders in Tower spin-off Australian Wealth Management took up just under 78 per cent of their entitlements under the new company&apos;s $130 million capital raising. The underwriter to the deal and major shareholder, Sir Ron Brierley&apos;s Guinness Peat Group, should end up with 30-odd per cent of the company.

			<TEXT>High world beef prices, increased productivity and better post-drought weather almost tripled the annual profit of the Australian Agricultural Company.  
For the 12 months to December 31, AACo&apos;s net profit after tax was $31.3 million, up $19.7 million on 2003.  
AACo received permission in December from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to change its balance date from June 30 to December 31 to better reflect its core activities. Big cash flows occur during the selling cycle from March to August.  
Operating revenue last year was $183.2 million, up 41.5 per cent on the $128.7 million in 2003.  
Chief executive Don Mackay said weather last year was closer to normal in most AACo regions in Queensland and the Northern Territory. This season had started well but more rain was needed.  
Operations had been boosted by the $80 million acquisition of the Victoria River Group. Herd numbers were 524,000 at December 31 against 395,000 in 2003. Cattle sales last year were 175,725, up from 135,892. A total of 45.3 million kilograms of beef was sold compared with 35.4 million kilograms in 2003.  
The firm&apos;s flagship &quot;1824&quot; brand increased package sales to Asia. AACo was working closely with Coles Myer promoting 1824 brand in supermarkets.

			<TEXT>Farm sector will slow the economy  
THE drought affecting Australia&apos;s farms is likely to have an impact on growth in gross domestic product and hit earnings in several companies focused on agriculture, according to a Goldman Sachs JBWere report.  
The report, put together by the economics and emerging companies teams, says the Australian Agricultural Company (AAco), Futuris Corp, Incitec Pivot and Nufarm are most sensitive to drought, and cattle producer AAco is likely to be the hardest hit.  
AAco operates 24 cattle stations in Queensland and the Northern Territory and two feedlots, and although the company has access to water, it is likely to be affected by falling beef prices.  
The analysts said they estimated that the fall in domestic beef prices would reduce earnings by about 11 per cent in calendar 2007.  
&quot;Droughts can lead to excessive de-stocking of cattle, which would see prices fall further,&quot; they said.  
Taking Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics predictions of a 36 per cent drop in winter crop production into account, the report suggests GDP growth may be shackled by the farm sector.  
&quot;Our 3.6 per cent growth forecast for 2006-07 already incorporates significant drag from the farm sector equivalent to 0.6 per cent subtraction from GDP for that year,&quot; the report says.  
&quot;Given the deterioration in conditions subsequently and more dire predictions from some private sector forecasters, the risks to our forecast remain on the downside.&quot;  
The report, titled The Drought: economic impact and stock-specific risks, says Futuris, which has an interest in Elders and AAco, may be affected by the drought&apos;s flow-on effects as farmers and other rural dwellers cut spending.  
It assesses the drought-sensitivity of Incitec Pivot and Nufarm as medium, saying sales and profit will be affected when farmers decide to plant fewer crops, requiring less fertiliser or crop protection products.  
The report also identifies Bendigo Bank, McGuigan Simeon Wines, Select Harvests and Timbercorp as sensitive to drought, although it labels their risk as low.  
With just 2.5 per cent of Australia&apos;s economic output coming from the agricultural sector, the economy is less affected by drought and downturns than it used to be. However, because agricultural outputs rise and fall sharply, it is still significant and has a knock-on effect.  
&quot;In the event of a prolonged drought, we see a widespread secondary impact throughout the economy including the retail sector,&quot; the report says.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIAN Agricultural Company has increased the valuation of its massive land portfolio on the eve of a bidding war triggered by the imminent sale of a majority stake in the company.   
The company told the market yesterday the value of its properties - which are mostly in the country&apos;s far north - had increased by $180 million in the past six months.   
AA Co commissioned valuations of its 24 cattle stations and two feedlots after the company was effectively put on the auction block in October when Futuris announced it wanted to sell its 43 per cent stake, which was worth $344million at yesterday&apos;s close.   
The properties sprawl over nearly 8 million hectares of land in Queensland and the Northern Territory.   
The valuations of the independent Herron Todd White were expected to boost net tangible assets per share by about 49c to about $2.87, the company said.   
Assets per share have increased by 41 per cent in three years despite a depressed cattle market and high grain prices.   
The scarcity of good beef producing properties and the worldwide trend towards higher-protein diets are pushing prices to historic highs.   
One AA Co property alone - Wrotham Park Station in the Queensland Gulf Country - produced an average of 14 per cent annual capital growth over the past 21 years.   
The Northern Territory and Queensland have also been receiving better rainfall than southern regions, thanks to monsoon conditions over summer.   
Market observers have said the assets were likely to be sold in one line.   
Potential buyers include Macquarie Pastoral Fund and the local beef producer  Teys Brothers as well as overseas interests such as Cargill of the US and Brazil&apos;s JBS group, which bought the meat processor Australian Meat Holdings earlier this year.   
Analysts believe shareholders could receive up to $3.77 a share if a full takeover bid is made, 18 per cent up on yesterdays close.   
Futuris, whose Elders subsidiary owns the stake, decided to sell because the holding was not spinning off enough cash and the company wanted to focus on its forestry and telecommunications operations.   
AA Co recently moved away from selling generic meat to meatworks and into branded beef and wagyu beef for the Japanese market, as a way to increase profit margins. Its shares closed up 2c at $3.21 yesterday.

			<TEXT>LES WOZNICZKA&apos;S decisionto put  Futuris Corp&apos;s $300 million-plus 43 per cent stake in  Australian Agricultural Co on the block is a googly for AAco, and possibly for the Federal Government.   
On one level, AAco will be pleased to see the back of Futuris, which spun off AAco in 2001. The Perth-based group&apos;s presence on the cattle company&apos;s share register has maintained a choke on the supply of shares available to big active institutional traders, and handed Futuris an effective power of veto over equity-funded expansion.   
But the move also potentially unsettles AAco because the Futuris chief&apos;s preferred exit route will not be one AAco itself would choose.   
The cattle company got a heads-up from Futuris that the sale decision was about to be announced, but was not consulted about it. That is possibly because its own interests are best served by a distribution of the shares to the market, to open up its register, reinstate a takeover premium, and expand its equity capital market options.   
However, Wozniczka&apos;s aim is to get the best outcome for his shareholders, not AAco&apos;s. And he can do that by locating a single buyer willing to pay a premium for the effective control the 43 per cent stake delivers. A block sale should in turn force a bid for the entire company, so in that sense Futuris has put AAco into play, with all the attendant complications.   
Citigroup has been chosen by Futuris to examine sale options - in league, as is often the case these days - with a boutique adviser, Caliburn. There are potential Australian buyers. But if the search leads to an offshore-based group, the sell-off will also inevitably have political undertones for the government next year, be it a renewed Howard government or a new Rudd one.   
There is nothing in Australia&apos;s open-door foreign investment stance to suggest that should be the case, of course. But AAco runs more than half a million cattle across northern Australia, on 24 properties that cover no less than 7 million hectares. That is about 1.2 per cent of the country&apos;s land mass. If there is an iconic rural asset in this country, the 183-year-old AAco is it.   
Wozniczka indicated yesterday that Futuris was essentially looking to crystallise profits from a buy-and-hold strategy, taking a capital gain on an asset that is generating a low earnings yield on profits that slipped from $16.1 million to $5.6 million in calendar 2006, and $5.9 million in the June half this year. The cattle company may actually post a small loss for the full year as it continues to build cattle numbers. But as the CSFB analyst Andrew Butterell noted in a recent report, AAco is an asset play, not an earnings one, and it is on that basis it will be sold and bought. A sale in the first half of next year would also be well timed for Futuris, because its own rural services profits are being pressured by drought conditions in southern Australia.   
Futuris spun AAco out as a separate listed company in August 2001 after lowering the sale price to attract investors, and AAco underperformed as a listed company initially, dipping below its $1 a share float price and not regaining it until mid 2002.   
But this year its shares have risen, from $1.83 in mid-January to a high of $3.34 on August 2, before sliding back to $2.50 in mid-August, as the entire market sank, and to $2.50 again this month, as investors factored in lower beef prices and a return to more competitive conditions in East-Asian markets.   
AAco has had good rainfall across its north Australian properties, which are geared to the annual monsoon season, and cattle prices in the north have held up. But prices in the south have fallen by almost 20 per cent since June, as cattle are sold to reduce numbers before what is likely to a drought-affected summer, and as Australian beef exports to East Asia facing growing competition from South America and from the US and Canada, which were locked out of East Asia for about three years after a bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease) scare.   
The possibility that Futuris could sell the stake in one hit at a premium and trigger a bid for the balance was reflected in the market yesterday, with AAco&apos;s shares rising 30c, or 12 per cent, to $2.80, valuing the entire company at $718 million and Futuris&apos;s stake at $309 million. Futuris&apos;s shares also rose by 11.5c, or almost 6 per cent, to $2.10.   
AAco is already trading at a healthy premium to its net tangible assets of $2.38 a share, and its price could go higher if the sale announcement flushes out interest here and overseas.   
Possible Australian buyers include  Macquarie Bank&apos;s new pastoral fund, which plans to run a $1 billion rural property portfolio, and there is a precedent for a consortium offer in the AMP&apos;s $490 million sale of its  Stanbroke Pastoral Company to an investor group that included Hungry Jack&apos;s founder, Jack Cowin, in 2003. Stanbroke was profitably broken up the following year. AAco was the unsuccessful high bidder in the AMP&apos;s 2003 sale, and launched legal action that resulted in a $10 million settlement by AMP.   
The Packer family has also been a big player with its Consolidated Pastoral operation. But with James Packer now focusing on the casino industry, its commitment is uncertain.   
Overseas interest in AAco cannot be discounted, with Asian groups including Singapore&apos;s  Temasek Holdings mentioned as possible buyers.

			<TEXT>A former pollie takes on too much but keeps in mind the need for happiness.   
He still has the Akubra hat. Tim Fischer might now look every inch the businessman he is, wearing a jacket and tie in the library of Melbourne&apos;s The Naval &amp; Military Club, but he confides that his favourite headwear is upstairs in his room.   
Since he voluntarily left politics in 2001 - after standing down as leader of the National Party and deputy prime minister in 1999 - Fischer, 61, has had a jammed work diary. He has just finished a three-year term as the inaugural chairman of Tourism Australia. He is a director of the  Australian Agricultural Company (the world&apos;s largest cattle owner with 560,000 head of cattle), Ausmore (a Singaporean school for expats), APT Freightlink (which operates the Darwin-Adelaide rail link) and Deloitte Automotive.   
And there are numerous honorary roles for various causes, including chair of the Australia-Thailand Institute, patron of the Royal Flying Doctor Service and patron of the Australian Unity Wellbeing Index, which measures Australians&apos; happiness.   
Now, mindful that one of the reasons he gave up politics was to spend more time with his two sons (the elder, Harrison, has autism), Fischer says that over the next nine months he will step down from several positions.   
&quot;I overreacted to leaving Parliament and probably took on a few too many things,&quot; he says. &quot;I wanted to make sure I wasn&apos;t going to hit a brick wall.&quot; He has prepared a document for other retiring pollies, on seven steps to ease the transition. His advice is to pick one or two causes to help.   
&quot;I still haven&apos;t got the balance quite right,&quot; says the idiosyncratic Fischer, who was described by the former ALP leader Kim Beazley as &quot;one of the very genuinely loved people in this place&quot;. &quot;Judy [his wife] still does more of the heavy lifting than I do. I want to put more time in over the next few years.&quot;   
Easing back will include more time at home near Wodonga, writing. Fischer has already penned three books (one on three transcontinental railways, another on outback heroes and one on the election in East Timor in 2000) and is halfway through another about the tiny Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan and work-life balance, co-written with Tshering Tashi. Fischer travels to Bhutan every second year (he is off trekking there next month) and greatly admires their &quot;Gross National Happiness Index&quot;, which is meshed into their political policies. &quot;They are people of modest means who are content, happy and engaged,&quot; says Fischer, one of the few to use the meditation room in Parliament House.   
He also has plans to write &quot;a biography with a twist&quot; on John Monash, whom Fischer describes as &quot;a much underrated great Australian&quot;.   
Does he miss politics after 30 years in the NSW and federal parliaments? &quot;No. I joked with [former Victorian premier] Steve Bracks about this at Tullamarine. You move on. I&apos;m not Paul Keating. Bob Hawke, Tim Fischer and Peter Reith have moved on, to pick three.&quot;   
Asked what he is most proud of from his political career and he immediately nominates two things: the Darwin-Adelaide rail link and supporting John Howard on gun control legislation.   
&quot;In 1996, Australia took a big turn when it walked away from the US [National Rifle Association] model and drained the suburbs of semi-automatics and automatics,&quot; Fischer says. &quot;I&apos;m still hated by some for that, and I&apos;m still very proud of it.&quot;   
THE BIG ISSUES   
Biggest break Ironically, it was winning the national service ballot in 1966, aged 20. I remember receiving my call-up notice on the steps of Darwin post office. I was put in the officer-training unit and graduated as a second lieutenant. I learnt person management skills and leadership. It was the great door-opener.   
Biggest achievement Coming from a small dusty town in the Riverina and six years at Boree Creek Primary School to be 16 times acting prime minister of this country, leader of the National Party and deputy PM.   
Biggest regret Not having done a part-time uni degree when I was in the NSW Parliament, being in opposition and having the time. I probably would have done arts-politics or arts-law.   
Best investment Mathematically, a tiny mining company called Wedgetail, although I had only a small stake. And the unit I own at Bronte Beach. I bought it in 1981 for $99,000 - two bedrooms and a lock-up garage. My father thought it was a complete waste of money.   
Worst investment Years ago, I bought Clyde Engineering shares. They had a good product but it never went anywhere.   
Attitude to money It&apos;s a means to achieve certain outcomes. I would lie if I said other than I like to have enough to be comfortable and care for my family. But you do need to balance the material with the naturally magnificent.   
Personal philosophy To be fair-minded and generous and tolerant, based on a broad Christian interpretation but respectful of Buddhist, Islamic and Jewish mainstream faiths. Three of those four revere Abraham and Moses, so there&apos;s much to unite the world.

			<TEXT>FINDING a sexy bit of meat can be as complex, mysterious and difficult as identifying sex appeal in a person, says Tim Slack-Smith.   
&quot;You know, the mouth is wrong, the eyes are wrong, the nose is wrong, but when you put them together, there&apos;s a certain something.&quot;   
But in an era of brand worship, even steaks now come with designer labels to make finding sex appeal a surer thing, and three years ago the Royal Agricultural Society added &quot;branded beef&quot; to its Sydney Royal Fine Food Show.   
Terra Rossa, Richard Gunner&apos;s Fine Meats, Certified Australian Angus, Stockyard, AJ Bush and Sons and the  Australian Agricultural Company&apos;s 1824 are the Prada, Gucci and Armani of the steak world, brands that promise to arouse the taste buds, at a price.   
Mr Slack-Smith will be steward-in-chief today when 16 branded beef entries are judged at the Sydney Showgrounds.   
As well as an open class, there are categories for grain-fed and grass-fed beef. Entries must meet the criteria of Meat Standards Australia, which has set eating quality standards based on the taste test responses of 60,000 consumers. Factors include breed content, meat colour, fat depth, marbling and maturity.   
Mr Slack-Smith said each judge was served a raw steak exactly 25 millimetres thick to study texture and colour. They run their fingers across the meat to feel its grain and look for the gristle that causes toughness and the fat marbling that brings tenderness.   
They are served a cut which has been cooked for exactly 90 seconds at 175 degrees in a clamshell cooker so it is served medium-rare, the optimum state for picking out a steak&apos;s strengths and weaknesses when it comes to flavour, tenderness and juiciness.   
Consumers rate tenderness the most important factor in a steak and the judges also give it the biggest weighting.   
Mr Slack-Smith said people looking for a sexy steak should go for branded beef. &quot;Look for someone who&apos;s prepared to put a brand to their product, so if there&apos;s a bad experience you have got some comeback.&quot;   
In the bread, cake and pie competition last week, no bread or meat pie was deemed worthy of the title of champion.   
The Gumnut Patisserie in the Southern Highlands, however, took top honours in the fine food show&apos;s cake and pastry section for its mudcake and tartlets, and won champion gourmet pie for its lamb and rosemary creation.   
Yesterday, judges were mulling over the cut grass and green tomato flavours of Australia&apos;s finest extra-virgin olive oils.   
Go the whole hog - Good Living   
TOP STEAK TIPS   
* Cattle should put on at least 600 grams a day for 30 days before slaughter.   
* Tropical breeds such as Brahman produce tougher meat.   
* Calm cattle produce superior meat.   
* After slaughter, suspend carcasses by the pelvis to achieve &quot;tenderstretch&quot;. Hanging from the ankle leads to tougher meat.   
* Cattle should be slaughtered within 36 hours of leaving the farm.   
* Beef improves through ageing.

			<TEXT>THE nation&apos;s biggest beef producer, Australian Agricultural Co, has positioned itself for carbon trading and developing high-value agriculture in Australia&apos;s north.   
In the interim, the company&apos;s outlook is positive due to a generally good wet season and strong world demand for beef.   
Chief executive Don Mackay, speaking at the annual meeting in Brisbane yesterday, said the worries about water in the Murray-Darling Basin had created interest in northern Australia. A more varied, robust and productive agricultural region could be developed there.   
&quot;AAco&apos;s strong foothold in areas of reliable rainfall, high run-off and quality soil types should become an increasingly valuable asset,&quot; he said.   
Mr Mackay said the company was committed to biological, not chemical, solutions for environmental problems. &quot;At Carrum Station, for example, we have introduced a goat herd to control the invasive weed prickly acacia,&quot; he said.   
Mr Mackay said that for northern agricultural development to occur, there needed to be regulatory change, particularly on restrictions governing pastoral leases.   
Chairman Nick Burton Taylor said AAco could benefit from the emerging carbon market by developing carbon abatement projects, or &quot;carbon sinks&quot;.   
&quot;It is unfortunate that Federal Government policy has precluded the agricultural sector as an active participant in the development of carbon trading policies,&quot; he said. &quot;It is one of our management tasks to construct a mechanism for AAco to enter this emerging and exciting market sector.&quot;   
Mr Mackay said the company&apos;s northern stations were in fine condition after a good wet season. Further south as far as Victoria, conditions were more uncertain despite some good rain. &quot;Along with a higher Australian dollar, this has led to price falls in a number of market categories,&quot; he said.   
However, Mr Mackay said internationally, demand for beef remained strong, although the return of US beef to Korea was a threat. &quot;Offsetting this ... is continued demand for quality beef in Korea, which has remained unsatisfied from limited Australian exports,&quot; he said. &quot;AAco&apos;s largest customer in Korea, the large Emart Hypermarket chain, has recently visited our operations and confirmed their commitment to selling AAco beef in their 106 stores.&quot;   
AAco fell 4c to$2.56.

			<TEXT>AGRICULTURE
IN A bid to shore up its dwindling share price, the Australian Agricultural Company has unveiled a $250 million deal to sell five of its properties into a joint venture.
The news kicked AAco shares above $2 for the first time this month, but they failed to hold there, closing at $1.825 for a 14.5c gain on the day.
The chief executive, Stephen Toms, said there was &quot;a big disconnect&quot; between the high prices at which rural properties were trading and the company&apos;s sharemarket valuation.
The group has 26 properties, valued on its books at about $800 million, and some 600,000 head of cattle, worth about $400 million, against $400 million of debt - yet its market capitalisation is less than $500 million.
AAco is hoping that the heads of agreement signed with specialist rural investor Primary Holdings International will produce a re-rating of its shares.
Also hoping for the re-rating is Malcolm Jackman, chief executive of Futuris, which has its 43 per cent stake in AAco on the market.
Mr Jackman said yesterday that Futuris, which before he took over the reins forced a wholesale change in AAco&apos;s board this year, was &quot;supportive&quot; of Mr Toms&apos; plan and had been &quot;kept in the loop&quot;.
Mr Jackman said Futuris had not been told which five properties were being sold into the joint venture with Primary Holdings. It is believed they are the five abutting runs north-east of Mt Isa in Queensland - Wondoola, Canobie, Kalmeta, Dalgonally and Clonagh.
AAco said once the deal was completed it would likely use the money to retire debt and buy back shares.
Primary Holdings is run by two sets of brothers in Australia - Bob and James Tucker and Angus and Bryce Graham. It was set up as a rural investor about a year ago with $US20 million ($30 million) in backing from the Origo investment group in London.

			<TEXT>Michael Evans would like a flat white with two sugars and a muffin.
TO THE list of Greg Paramor&apos;s hobbies, including train caboose owner, tree lopper, winemaking and barracking for the Swans, it&apos;s perhaps time to add barista.
Since he found himself walking the plank from Mirvac, it appears Paramor has been reacquainting himself with his neighbourhood in Palm Beach.
And word is Paramor has teamed up with former Australian Agricultural Company chairman Nick Burton Taylor and some chums to take out the lease on the Barrenjoey Boathouse cafe, known as Carmel&apos;s By the Sea.
It sounds rather convenient, given Burton Taylor and Paramor both have houses in Palm Beach. And it&apos;s not a bad location, on the Pittwater side of Palm Beach, just past the golf course, and where the seaplanes land. They&apos;re said to have been doing some internal renovations but haven&apos;t yet been spotted behind the counter.
When we reached Paramor on Friday, he wasn&apos;t too keen to discuss the venture, saying only &quot;there&apos;s a syndicate of people&quot; and he was &quot;trying to stay out of the media&quot;. We can only wonder why.
Apart from walking the Mirvac plank this year, we&apos;ve spotted him having an issue or two with Pittwater Council for tree lopping without permission and then getting his renovations rejected by the council. Still, making a few coffees near home is more practical than keeping an eye on his Barossa Valley wine venture with Janet Holmes a Court every weekend, not to mention taking his train caboose, the John Forrest, out for a spin.
Company man
It&apos;s tough looking after your own interests when you&apos;re busy keeping an eye on everyone else&apos;s paperwork. Ask Kerry Parker. The company secretary at Brisbane tiddler Panax Geothermal has scored a please-explain from the market regulator about some tardy directors notices that one of the company&apos;s director&apos;s had lodged. The thing is, they were his very own.
The ASX pointed out to Parker, who doubles as company secretary and director, that he had traded shares 22 times between January and October, noting that the paperwork had been a bit late on more than one occasion. Parker, the company chap responsible for dealing with the query, replied that it was the company&apos;s fault. It appears he was too bashful to lay blame.
For the first bunch of transactions, Parker wrote that &quot;Panax advises that it has inadvertently omitted to prepare or lodge these documents&quot;. For later transactions, Parker pointed out that the &quot;documents had been prepared for lodgement but that it had inadvertently not lodged these documents.&quot;
We&apos;d hate to think he&apos;s referring to himself as &quot;it&quot;. Parker promised that Panax would try harder, detailing a new disclosure regime for director dealings. He didn&apos;t explicitly say if he too would try harder.
Board riders
When the roof caves in, it&apos;s considered polite to step out of the public eye for a while.
But Gordon Fell isn&apos;t the only former Allco bod ditching some trophy board spots while keeping others.
After Gordy bailed from the boards of the Smith Family and Opera Australia, his position on the board of the Sydney Grammar Board of Trustees came under scrutiny from school parents wondering exactly how the likes of ASX chairman David Gonski and Federal Court judge Arthur Emmett felt about being in the same room.
Now the mutterings have started about Gordy&apos;s Allco Coe-hort, David Coe.
Coe quit as chairman of the Museum of Contemporary Art earlier this year, even though he had flung a few million in its direction. But it turns out Coe hung on to his spot on the board of the fund-raising foundation of the Sydney Children&apos;s Hospital, despite having decided it was time to relocate overseas. A spokesthing confirms Coe is still on the board.
Game on
One billionaire&apos;s passion is a nation&apos;s indulgence.
So it was good to see Frank Lowy easing himself of that conflict of interest he had as an owner of Sydney Football Club just hours before Prime Minister Kevin Rudd threw squillions at the round ball game to try and get its mitts on the World Cup. Lowy offloaded his stake in the Sydney soccer team to hospital and media baron Paul Ramsay in cahoots with Russian businessman David Traktovenko.
The Russian&apos;s daughter happens to be married to an Australian, Scott Barlow, who will head the club. Still, buying a footy team might bring the extra advantage of making trips to Australia to visit the family and stay in his own Mosman pile tax deductible.
Lowy and Ramsay aren&apos;t alone in their affections for the world game, with Wollongong-Bermudan gazillionaire Bruce Gordon also trying to secure a licence to run a team in the local league.
Worth the wait
Former corporate plodster Tony Hartnell&apos;s much-anticipated case with the taxman over the deductibility of $800,000 or so of horse-training expenses has been pushed back into the new year. The case, brought by latter-day corporate lawyer with Atanaskovic Hartnell, had been due to start today. But we hear the taxman asked for more hearing days, leaving the whole thing being pushed into 2009.

			<TEXT>AGRIBUSINESS
AUSTRALIAN Agricultural Co has slumped into the red, capping a turbulent period that included a boardroom stoush with its dominant shareholder, Futuris.
In yesterday&apos;s half-yearly results, AACo said it made a $2.2 million loss in the six months to June, after a $5.9 million profit in the previous corresponding period.
The main reasons it gave were lower cattle prices and a strong Australian dollar eroding export earnings. It also said the acting chief executive, Stephen Toms, would take the reins permanently, after standing in since May.
Shortly before Mr Tom&apos;s appointment, the majority shareholder, Futuris Corp, ousted the chairman, Nick Burton-Taylor. Two other directors resigned in protest.
Mr Toms was optimistic that beef prices would go up soon as the supply of cattle fell from its present level above the long term-trend, dragging down the price.
&quot;We&apos;re expecting the long-term trend to correct itself, as it always does. I&apos;m expecting that to happen in the next six months and for the next two years after that, while world protein demand stays where it is,&quot; he said.
Higher fuel, grain and labour costs also ate into margins, and the cuts to profit was particularly sharp because the previous year&apos;s results included an $8.8 million settlement with the fund manager, AMP.
With a good season in NSW, Queensland and the Northern Territory, the wholesale beef segment result was a $1.5 million profit after a $300,000 loss last year. The company will pay a dividend of 7c a share.
Mr Toms said cash flow - which was $5.9 million over the six months - was a more accurate gauge of the business than the loss, because yearly profits fluctuated according to cattle prices.
Building on the predicted rise in cattle prices, the company forecast its cash flow would be about $15 million for the next financial year.
AAco has cut its gearing ratio from 40 per cent to 36 per cent over the year and Mr Toms said he would continue to focus on this amid high credit pressures.
He said the departure of Mr Burton-Taylor and the other directors had helped management to focus on company priorities.
&quot;What we have now is a board which is much more aligned with management,&quot; he said.
AAco shares were steady at $3.01.

THE chairman of Australian Agricultural Company, Nick Burton-Taylor, will face an uphill battle to keep his job at the cattle producer&apos;s annual general meeting today.
Futuris Corporation, which owns a 43 per cent stake in AACo, announced yesterday it would oppose Mr Burton-Taylor&apos;s re-election.
An AACo statement said that if Futuris opposed Mr Burton-Taylor&apos;s re-election, two other members of AACo&apos;s board, Chris Roberts and Greg Paramour, would stand down in protest.
With former deputy prime minister Tim Fischer set to end his term on the AACo board today, the cattle rancher may lose four of its six board members in one hit.
The news comes two weeks after Futuris abandoned an attempt to sell its stake in the cattle producer, because it could not find a suitable buyer for AACo, which owns about 8 million hectares of land in Queensland and the Northern Territory.
Mr Burton-Taylor said in a statement to the sharemarket: &quot;Les Wozniczka, CEO and managing director of Futuris Corporation Limited, advised yesterday that Futuris would not be supporting my re-election as a director of the AACo board.&quot;
Soon after the announcement, AACo&apos;s largest shareholder confirmed the news: &quot;Futuris has concluded that the chairman&apos;s re-election is contrary to its interests, and the best interests of other AACo shareholders.&quot;
Mr Burton-Taylor said he believed Futuris was opposing his re-election as a form of &quot;blame-shifting&quot; for the failed sale of AACo, which he described as &quot;flawed from beginning to end&quot;.
Relations between AACo and Futuris had been tense, but not damaging, since Futuris announced it would sell its $325 million stake in the cattle company in October last year, Mr Burton-Taylor said.
AACo initially advised against its sale with the emergence of credit problems and the subprime crisis, but the advice was overlooked, he said.
A Futuris spokesman said: &quot;We&apos;ll be disclosing the reasons for our decision in the proper forum, which is the AACo annual general meeting.&quot;
Futuris said it had not sought the resignations of directors Mr Paramour and Mr Roberts.
AACo&apos;s share price has slipped since Futuris announced it was abandoning the sale, from $3.19 beforehand to $2.90 yesterday.

			<TEXT>CATTLE COMPANIES AGRICULTURE AUSTRALIA WA
AUSTRALIA&apos;s second biggest cattle company has shrugged off a potentiallydisastrous mad cow disease scare in Japan and a weaker global economy topost a strong first-quarter result.
Higher cattle prices and increased sales helped Australian AgriculturalCompany double its earnings before interest and tax to $17.1 million, upfrom $8.3 million reported in the previous corresponding period andahead of forecasts.
Shares in the newly listed beef producer gained 6.1 per cent, or 5 centsto 86 cents, off last week&apos;s lows around 73 cents.
Cattle revenue was up 42 per cent to $31 million during the quarter,compared with $21.8 million in the first quarter last year.
This was because of higher cattle prices, increased sales volumes andhigher herd values as a result of new accounting practices relating toself-generating and re-generating assets (SGARA).
Excluding the SGARA impact, underlying earnings increased from $4.3million to $10.3 million.
Despite the first-quarter results tracking above forecasts contained inthe company&apos;s July prospectus, AACo chief executive Peter Holmes a Courtwas wary of predicting it would exceed its full year forecast of $35.7million in EBIT, resulting in a net profit of $21.1 million.
&quot;We are performing on track,&quot; he said.
While the BSE scare in Japanese beef markets has seen demand slump andhad an impact on producers, Mr Holmes a Court said beef prices werestill buoyant.
&quot;Beef prices were up about 20 per cent and now they are about 5 per centhigher, which is still higher than our forecast of 3 per cent,&quot; he said.&quot;We were able to take advantages of the higher prices earlier in theyear and sell accordingly&quot;.
AACo sold 7.6 million kilograms of meat in the quarter, up from 5.9million kilograms for the previous corresponding period.
Mr Holmes a Court said AACo was continuing to pursue its growthstrategies of increasing its herd size, vertically integrating up thevalue chain and building both wholesale and retail brands.
He was unperturbed about AACo&apos;s share price, which has not traded aboveits $1 issue price for retail investors or reached the $1.10institutional shareholders forked out for a slice of the beef company.

			<TEXT>WHEAT COMPANIES WA SHAREMARKETS AUSTRALIA INVESTMENTS
WHEAT trader AWB harvested a premium price for its shares on debutyesterday, trading 10 per cent above the $3.15 issue price at their peak.
The shares opened at $3.42, oscillated between $3.34 and $3.49, and heldon to the bulk of their gains to close at $3.46, valuing the company at$945.7 million.
AWB chairman and Katanning farmer Trevor Flugge was happy with theperformance.
&quot;Things have gone exceptionally well,&quot; he said.
&quot;I think the opening values have shown the confidence we were lookingfor.&quot;
The success of the wheat group listing contrasts with beef playAustralian Agricultural Company (AACo) which hit the boards on August10.
AACo shares, issued at $1, opened at 99 cents and peaked at $1.04 beforeeasing to close at 99 cents.
Yesterday, AACo ended steady at 93 cents.
But Mr Flugge said it was wrong to compare AWB and AACo.
&quot;We&apos;ve really got a significant track record and I think people lookingto the future can see that we&apos;ve got a very clear growth pattern that&apos;sdeveloping,&quot; he said.
&quot;The other thing is we&apos;ve got quite a diversified business rather thanjust basically cattle like the ag company.&quot;
The former Australian Wheat Board&apos;s $100 million share offer closedheavily oversubscribed last Wednesday with about 60 per cent of the 31.8million, non-voting, B-class shares going to institutions.
Clients of brokers connected to the float snagged about 20 per cent withthe remaining 20 per cent snapped up by existing shareholders andemployees.
Only about 13 per cent of the company was sold off with growers holdingthe bulk of the 273.3 million B-class shares, most of which were issuedin July 1999.
Growers also own A-class shares which carry voting rights but cannot betraded.
Mr Flugge said the B-class shares would be fairly tightly held by wheatgrowers although he suggested some farmers probably sold part of theirholding yesterday to balance their share portfolio.
&quot;There&apos;s going to be that sort of adjustment taking place for sometime,&quot; he said.
About three million shares changed hands in the first 10 minutes afterAWB came on to the market at 10am Perth time with 8.4 million sharestraded by the end of the day.
Listed bulk grain handler Graincorp has emerged as the biggestshareholder with a 2.3 per cent stake.
Mr Flugge said AWB&apos;s business relationship with Graincorp went back manyyears.
&quot;They provide significant services in New South Wales and Victoria instorage and handling,&quot; he said.
Other major shareholders include the Queensland Investment Corporation,Chase Manhattan and Australia&apos;s big four banks.
AWB chief executive Andrew Lindberg said in May the company was on trackto deliver a net profit of about $77 million for the full year toSeptember 30 after recording a 25 per cent rise in interim net profit to$52.4 million on revenue of $1.3 billion.
About 62 per cent of first half revenue came from finance and riskmanagement products sold to growers, 23 per cent from grain trading andchartering, 5 per cent from management fees for running the non-profitpools for export wheat and 10 per cent from its overseas flour millinterests and domestic handling facilities.

			<TEXT>WHEAT AGRICULTURE WA COMPANIES AUSTRALIA INVESTMENTS SHAREMARKETS
WHEAT marketer and financier AWB will be hoping for a better sharemarketdebut than its rural cousin Australian Agricultural Company (AACo) whenits shares hit the boards on Wednesday.
The former Australian Wheat Board&apos;s $100 million share offer closed welloversubscribed yesterday after strong demand from institutional andretail investors, employees and existing wheat grower shareholders,claimed the company.
AACo&apos;s $193 million float also attracted strong interest with investorsclamouring to get a slice of the beef company but its shares listedbelow its $1 retail offer price and have hovered in the 93 cents to 97cents range.
The grower-controlled AWB is looking to raise up to $100 million,including about $60 million from institutional investors, via the issueof 31.8 million B-class shares at $3.15 each.
The shares issued will represent about 12 per cent of the issued capitalof AWB, with an existing 242 million shares, mostly held by wheatfarmers, also tradable from next week.
The $860 million float has drawn criticism from some wheat growers whoare angry the majority of shares have been offered to public investors,claiming it amounts to &quot;selling off the farm&quot;.
AWB chairman and Katanning farmer Trevor Flugge said wheat growersalready held the vast majority of shares and the offer had been designedto attract institutions to the share register and promote liquidity inthe stock.
&quot;Really to get some liquidity which will put the true value on the stockyou need the institutional interest,&quot; he said.

THE Australian Agricultural Company has devoured Perth-based Jesters JafflePie Company in a cash and equity deal which will open the way for a campaignto launch the product nationally.
No financial details were disclosed on the deal which will see Brisbane andMelbourne become the first Eastern States cities to get the jaffle pies,with flavours such as the Ned Kelly, the Morning Glory and the Nutty Chook.
Jesters already has 31 franchised stores in WA and one in New Zealandselling its jaffle-iron pies. Their turnover is forecast to top $10 millionthis financial year.
Jesters gets a royalty plus income from supply of ingredients to stores.
The paddock-to-plate link with AACo gives Jesters access to beef from about400,000 head of cattle through AACo&apos;s Brisbane-based Chef Partners.
Yesterday, AACo chief executive Peter Holmes a Court would not reveal howmuch the deal was worth - except to say it equated to &quot;quite a lot of pies&quot;.
Jesters&apos; owners and directors Richard Anderson and Bill Richardson will joinAACo to work on expanding the business.
Mr Holmes a Court said AACo saw Jesters as an opportunity to introducenationwide a small business whose model had been proven in WA.
&quot;What it means for our beef is that we&apos;ll take our ground meat and that cango straight into the pies,&quot; he said. &quot;What it means for the customer is theycan buy a meat pie knowing where the beef came from.
&quot;It&apos;s hard enough for people to know that they are buying beef in their pieslet alone knowing exactly where it comes from.&quot;
Mr Holmes a Court said the recipe would not change.
Management and administration also would remain and franchisees would havethe backing of a big company that wanted to make Jesters a national chain.
Mr Anderson, Jesters&apos; managing director who helped found the jaffle businessin 1997, said he had mixed emotions over the sale but recognised it wasneeded to compete nationally.
&quot;The marriage between Jesters and AACo will give us the resources ... totake the business to the next step,&quot; Mr Anderson said.
&quot;We will be able to give our customers a lot more confidence so they knowexactly what is in that pie and where it came from.
&quot;We don&apos;t plan to change what is already a successful model, we just hopethat adding resources and adding the potential to apply resources will justimprove the business and improve the franchises.&quot;
AACo&apos;s shares lifted 2 cents to 94 cents yesterday.

AUSTRALIAN Agricultural company has boosted its drought defencestrategy and become Australia&apos;s third biggest feedlotter with theacquisition of a Southern Queensland feedlot and beef marketingbusiness.
AACo yesterday announced the purchase of Aronui Feedlot with therelease of its first quarter results, and coinciding with its annualmeeting held in Sydney.
Company chief executive Peter Holmes a Courtsaid Aronui would act as anadditional drought hedge for AACo if the dry conditions continued afterthe wet season.
In addition, Mr Holmes a Court emphasised that AAco was not in drought,and that it continuously managed for dry conditions.
&quot;The current herd levels at the properties are appropriate and notunder stress,&quot; he said.
&quot;Little rainfall for our company is received through the middle monthsof the calendar year, rainfall is generally monsoonal and so we are notin a position that is perhaps seen in a stereotypical way (of the)drought covering the whole country.&quot;
The deal also included Aronui&apos;s associated beef market business, KobeCuisine, which markets beef directly into supermarkets in Korea, Japan,Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia. The cost of the deal, still subjectto due diligence, was not disclosed.
&quot;(Kobe) gives us the ability to take our cattle directly to customersthere, without going through expensive middlemen,&quot; Mr Holmes a Courtsaid.
The company announced revenue of $25.7 million for the three months toSeptember 30, from beef sales of 10.4 million kilos.
The revenue figure represented a drop of $5.6 million, while firstquarter earnings before interest and tax were $7.7 million, comparedwith $17.1 million in the previous corresponding period.
The shortfall was attributed chiefly to lower cattle prices, and waspredicted by the company in August.
The company flagged an interim dividend, to be paid in May, and said itwas likely to maintain its 6.1 cents full year payout.
AACo shares closed 1 cents up at 74 cents.

AUSTRALIAN Agricultural Company is poised to capitalise on acquisitionopportunities after a tough year for the beef industry, which has beenhit by falling cattle prices, mad cow disease in key markets, a risingAustralian dollar and an acrimonious bunfight over US beef quotas.
Australia&apos;s second-biggest beef producer yesterday unveiled a netprofit of $20.6 million for the year to June 30, its first full year asa listed company, which was 30 per cent above the 2001 result (on anormalised basis) but just shy of its prospectus forecast of $21.1million.
But it warned 2003 earnings could shrink by as much as 20 per cent dueto year-on-year cattle prices falls and higher costs associated withdry conditions.
Its operating cash flow was 45 per cent higher at $25.5 million (beforeinterest and tax) despite higher grain prices and operating costs. Thesize of its herd increased by 18,000 to 407,000 and beef sales lifted 7per cent to 34.4 million kilograms.
The solid result pushed the 178-year-old company&apos;s share price up ashigh as 77 cents before it closed 5 cents higher at 75 cents.
&quot;Under challenging conditions we finished within 2 per cent of ourprospectus target,&quot; said AACo&apos;s chief executive Peter Holmes a Court.
&quot;We chose to hold back sales to take advantage of rising markets andfinished the year with 33,000 more cattle than the prospectus(forecast).&quot;
Mr Holmes a Court said AACo was cashed up, with gearing at 29.6 percent, leaving it well placed to take advantage of sectorrationalisation.
The company has made no secret of its intention to expand its herd tomore than one million.
&quot;But very rapidly rising prices in the first half of the year, and highnatural increases across the group made it inappropriate for us topursue this acquisition strategy,&quot; he said.
&quot;We think the acquisition outlook given current conditions issubstantially improved and we will pursue them actively.&quot;
The company yesterday announced it had bought 51 per cent of cattlemanagement group Rural Management Partners, for $500,000. Themanagement group has 60,000 head across 16 properties and generates afee of 2 per cent of assets under management.
This is expected to increase to 100,000 head under management thisyear. Mr Holmes a Court has made no secret of the company&apos;s strategy tobecome a leading supplier to the value-added beef markets in Australiato boost domestic sales which make up about 30 per cent of itsturnover.
&quot;This is not rocket science or financially complex, we&apos;re raisingcattle and selling people meat,&quot; he said.
Earlier this year, AACo set up a joint venture, Chefs Partner, tosupply high-quality branded beef to restaurants. This followed aninvestment in retailing with the purchase of a controlling interest inMelbourne-based meat retailer Polkinghornes.
Mr Holmes a Court said AACo planned to open two more Polkinghornes,roll out its new 1824-branded beef into Australia and Asia, increaseChef Partner sales week-on-week by 100 per cent and continue to pursue&quot;opportunistic acquisition opportunities&quot;.
&quot;We believe we have the ability to grow our value-added revenue fromone per cent of revenue to 10 per cent of revenue and lift total beefsold from about 34 to 50 million kilograms over the year,&quot; he said.
He stressed the drought was not affecting AACo&apos;s Queensland andNorthern Territory cattle stations.
There were also signs export prices in key markets such as Japan andKorea were improving.
AACo declared a fully-franked final dividend of 6.08 cents per share.

			<TEXT>MEAT COMPANIES AUSTRALIA RESTAURANTS INDUSTRIES SHAREMARKETS AUSTRALIATRADE CATTLE PASTORALISTS
PASTORAL company Australian Agricultural Company has launched the nextstage of its strategy designed to get more consumers eating its beef.
Yesterday it unveiled a new brand - 1824 - the label given to a premiumaged range of beef aimed at the restaurant industry.
The name marks the year the company was established.
The move is part of AACo&apos;s attempts to brand and position its beefproducts in response to consumer demand for more information about themeat they are eating.
&quot;We are putting processes in place that enable us to trace our beeffrom its origin in the paddock to its end product on the plate, and cantherefore assure customers that 1824 branded beef will be a guaranteedeating experience,&quot; said AACo chief executive Peter Holmes a Court.
The move is in line with the introduction of a broader meat gradingsystem by the industry which guarantees eating quality, in particularthe tenderness of a piece of beef. The Meat Standards Australia labelprovides the cooking method, removing the need to know the best use foreach cut of beef.
AACo has a herd of more than 400,000 head across 19 cattle stations inQueensland and the Northern Territory.
The grass-fed cattle are grain finished to produce prime-age beef withcuts sold in restaurants and supermarkets in Australia.
It also exports meat to Japan, Asia, the United States and the MiddleEast.
Since taking over the reins in July last year, Mr Holmes a Court hasbeen focused on promoting beef, against a backdrop of mad cow diseasescares in Europe and Japan.
AACo is due to report its full year result on Tuesday.
It shares closed unchanged at 66 cents.

SHARES in beef company Australian Agricultural Company are at six-monthlows, with news of a fourth case of mad cow disease in Japan expectedto put further pressure on its sales in the short term.
AACo shares closed 2 cents weaker yesterday at 77 cents after news ofthe latest outbreak at the weekend combined with wider market weaknessto squeeze the share price.
AACo shares reached an all-time low of 72 cents in September and havestruggled to get near the $1 issue price paid by retail investors lastJuly.
On Thursday, the stock closed at 76 cents after the company slashed itsfull year profit forecast by nearly 20 per cent on the back of fallingJapanese demand, uncertainty over US beef quotas and drier conditions.
The company said it would be hit by higher operating costs, thanks tohigher insurance, fuel and grain prices, but still expected to post afull year net profit of $23.2 million, 10 per cent higher than itsprospectus forecast.
AACo managing director Peter Holmes a Court said the company wasfocusing on the domestic market via its gate-to-plate strategy in a bidto mitigate reduced international demand.
In the longer term, the company&apos;s branding strategy, which revolvesaround food safety and traceability, should see it benefit from foodscares in other parts of the world.
However, there are fears the latest discovery will cause alreadynervous Japanese consumers to continue shunning red meat, includingAustralian imports.
Japan is Australia&apos;s second biggest beef market and the first discoveryof mad cow, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), last year causeda 70 per cent drop in beef consumption with demand for Australian beefdown more than 30 per cent.
Meat and Livestock Australia spokesman David Palmer said the latestoutbreak would have an impact on beef sales to Japan.
&quot;We&apos;ll have to wait and see what damage it does do, but Australia willcontinue to do what we need to do to restore consumer confidenceworking with Japanese authorities, but above all we need to get thatdisease in Japan eradicated from the herd,&quot; he told ABC radio.
The beef industry is also waiting for Agriculture Minister Warren Trussto announce how the United States quota will be allocated, with anyfall in demand in Japan putting pressure on producers to sell more beefinto other markets.
AACo is Australia&apos;s second biggest pastoral company behind theAMP-owned Stanbroke Pastoral and Mr Holmes a Court is aiming to make itthe world&apos;s biggest cattle company with a herd in excess of a million.

SHARES in Peter Holmes a Court&apos;s Australian Agricultural Company werecrunched by 5 per cent to near record lows yesterday as the marketreacted to Monday&apos;s profit downgrade which saw full year forecastsslashed by nearly 20 per cent.
AACo shares dropped 4 cents to 77 cents before easing to close 3 centslower at 78 cents.
The stock hit a low of 72 cents in late September and has only tradedabove the $1 issue price once, the day of its stock exchange debut.
On Monday, the 178-year-old cattle company said its full year earningswould be hit by falling beef prices in the second half. Beef priceshave fallen about 13 per cent since December and are down 25 per centon last spring&apos;s near record highs.
The beef company downgraded full year earnings before interest and tax(EBIT) to $37 million and net profit after tax to $23.3 million, 3.7per cent and 9.9 per cent respectively above prospectus forecasts.
JBWere analyst Matthew McNee said the &quot;mark-to-market&quot; requirements ofthe SGARA (self-generating and regenerating assets) accounting standardmade AACo&apos;s reported earnings highly dependent on beef prices atbalance day with a relatively minor 2 per cent change in beef priceshaving a 5 per cent impact on net profit.
He has downgraded his 2002 full year forecast by 18.3 per cent to $22.9million and his 2003 forecast by 3.8 per cent to $24.3 million andreduced his discounted cash flow valuation on the stock from $1.15 to$1.13.
&quot;While recent weakness in the beef price causes us to maintain acautious short-term view, in the longer term we see significant upsidefrom moving the AACo business further downstream to develop value added&apos;branded product&apos;,&quot; Mr McNee said.

			<TEXT>A VOLATILE cattle market will force Australian Agricultural Company onto the back foot in the second half but the big beef producer stillexpects to exceed its July prospectus full year profit forecast by 10per cent.
Australia&apos;s second biggest pastoral company yesterday revised downwardits full year profit forecast from $28.1 million to $23.2 million,compared with $21.1 million in its prospectus.
It said earnings before interest and tax would be lower than the $43.7million it forecast in February - but at $37 million still higher thanits prospectus forecast of $35.7 million.
AACo - which runs more than 400,000 cattle - posted a net profit of$28.14 million for the half year to December 31.
But it warned the outbreak of mad cow disease in Japan would see cattleprices drop significantly in the third and fourth quarters.
The SGARA (self-generating and regenerating assets) accounting standardmeans AACo&apos;s second half earnings are reliant on beef prices at June 30and the timing and number of cattle sales.
Beef prices have fallen about 13 per cent since December and are notexpected to rebound significantly in the next two months.
Unless prices recover, AACo will experience a negative SGARA adjustmentfor the second half, resulting in the lower profit for the full yearcompared with the first half.
SGARA means that a company&apos;s bottom line encounters greater volatilityas commodities prices change and inventory is therefore revalued. Thereis no impact on cash flow.
On Friday, Futuris Corp - which owns 40 per cent of AACo - hinted itcould be looking at a negative contribution from the beef company whenit announced its own profit downgrade. AACo said yesterday its latestforecast was based on a net cattle price increase of 6.8 per cent forthe year.
The 178-year-old pastoral company said cattle prices expectations forthe fourth quarter had been reduced on the back of US quotalimitations, weaker Japanese demand and drier weather conditions.
It also warned input costs, especially insurance, fuel and grain priceswere likely to push operating costs 10 per cent higher than previousforecasts.
AACo chief executive Peter Holmes a Court said the group was able tomove cattle across its vast property portfolio which helped offset theprice downturn and drier weather conditions.
&quot;The strength of our property portfolio, combined with our growingability to supply the domestic market, should allow the company toexceed prospectus forecasts despite the tougher conditions beingexperienced in the second half of the year,&quot; he said.
AACo&apos;s balance sheet remained strong with net tangible assets per sharearound $1, gearing at 41 per cent and EBIT cover of 8.3 timesinterest.
It is expected to finish the year with an estimated herd of 399,000compared with its forecast year-end herd number of 374,000.
AACo&apos;s earnings for the nine months to March 31 showed a 26 per centincrease to $23 million against $18.2 million in the previouscorresponding period.
Mr Holmes a Court said beef prices were expected to remain at currentlevels into the first half of 2002-2003 but AACo would seek to counterthe reduced international demand by focusing on domestic markets.
Meat and Livestock Australia expects domestic exports to Japan to fallby 11 per cent to 285,000 tonnes, the lowest level since 1996.
AACo shares closed 1 cents lower at 81 cents.

			<TEXT>CATTLE COMPANIES MEAT WA AUSTRALIA
SHARES in cattle company Australian Agricultural Company gained 3 centsto 89 cents yesterday after it announced another plank in its &quot;paddockto plate&quot; approach to controlling the supply of its beef.
The 178-year-old company has set up a joint venture, Chefs Partner, tosupply high quality branded beef to restaurants.
The partnership of AACo (45 per cent), with Gympie abattoir Nolan Meats(45 per cent) and meat industry identity Pat Dempsey (10 per cent),said it had bought Griffin&apos;s, a Brisbane supplier of high quality meatsto the food service market in Queensland and NSW for an undisclosedsum.
The move into the food service sector follows AACo&apos;s entry into beefretailing in November when the pastoral company bought the controllinginterest in Melbourne-based meat retailer Polkinghornes.
AACo chief executive Peter Holmes a Court said any expansion of thePolkinghornes&apos; stores in Queensland and NSW would be integrated withGriffin&apos;s.
&quot;Both investments represent AACo&apos;s commitment to broadening the group&apos;srevenue base and becoming a leading supplier to the value-added beefmarkets in Australia,&quot; he said.
AACo is highly exposed to volatile fluctuations in beef prices andmarkets, including Japan where the outbreak of mad cow disease latelast year has seen beef sales plummet.
Griffin&apos;s is expected to reap $10 million in annualised sales for thejoint venture by year end 2003 as the food service sector continues togrow rapidly.

			<TEXT>CATTLE FARMING AUSTRALIA TOURISM COMPANIES WA
SENDING his American in-laws on a tour of his company&apos;s vast cattleempire convinced Peter Holmes a Court there was a market for luxuryoutback tours aimed at the wealthy.
Approaches by travel operators confirmed the gap in the tourism marketexisted, one which could be used to create a significant marketingspin-off and raise awareness of Australian beef production at the sametime.
Australia&apos;s second biggest pastoral company, Australian AgriculturalCompany, headed by Mr Holmes a Court, yesterday announced it had teamedup with icon bush outfitter RM Williams Holdings to provide upmarketsafari-like tours to the outback.
The joint venture company, Authentic Outback Tours, will be operated bya third party and will take small groups of wealthy internationaltourists and corporate groups to camp on AACo&apos;s stations in far northQueensland and the Northern Territory.
AACo has more than 400,000 cattle on its land, which spans 6.5 millionhectares, or about 0.9 per cent of Australia&apos;s land mass.
Mr Holmes a Court said it was too early to say whether the venturewould be a major profit driver for the pastoral company, but it wouldhelp raise awareness about the scale and sustainability of Australianbeef production at a time overseas consumers were facing major foodscares such as mad cow disease.
Groups of 10 to 20 tourists will be given an outback experience at the$100,000 &quot;Governor&apos;s-type&quot; camps, which will feature hardwood floortents, quality fittings and gourmet food.
&quot;This is going to be on a par to the great African safaris ... thiswill be held in our spectacular properties, only a short hop fromCairns,&quot; Mr Holmes a Court said.
&quot;Visitors can get the Barrier Reef experience and then go on to have anoutback experience.&quot;
One of the proposed camping sites is on AACo&apos;s Brunette Downs station,350km north-east of Tennant Creek in the Northern Territory. It is thebiggest single cattle station in the country.
The first camp will be built on Wrathan Park near Cairns.
&quot;We have to find ways of using our assets better,&quot; said Mr Holmes aCourt, who stressed the tourism venture would not interfere with theday-to-day running of the beef properties.
The new company hoped to be operating with in-bound tourists early nextyear.
The rural companies first came together last year, offering AACoshareholders discounted boots and moleskins, via a 15 per cent discountcard for use in RM Williams retail stores.
Mr Holmes a Court said the relationship was a growing one.
AACo shares closed unchanged yesterday at 92 cents.
RM Williams was untraded again, closing at its January 24 level of$1.35.

SHARES in beef company Australian Agricultural Company bucked more than5 per cent, or 5 cents, to 93 cents yesterday after the company saidits full year earnings were likely to &quot;considerably exceed&quot; itsprospectus forecast of $35.7 million.
Earnings for the full year could be as high as $48 million after recordcattle prices in the first six months of the 2001-02 financial year.
In its prospectus, Australia&apos;s second oldest pastoral company forecast$35.7 million in earnings before interest and tax, resulting in a netprofit of $21.1 million in the full year to June 2002.
In November, chief executive Peter Holmes a Court was wary ofpredicting AACo would exceed its full year forecast, but said it wasperforming on track.
Strong prices in the first half to December are expected to offset anydrop in prices as a result of weaker demand in the BSE-hit Japanesemarket in the second half of the year.
AACo said cattle prices it achieved at sales in the second quarterthrough to the end of December continued to strengthen from Octoberlevels.
&quot;Current trading conditions are being affected by a number of externalevents, such as the BSE-mad cow disease outbreak in Japan, which causedcattle prices to come back from the record levels of late 2001,&quot; saidchief financial officer Luisa Catanzaro.
&quot;However, the market remains in advance of prices achieved at the startof the financial year.&quot;
Wholesale prices of Australian beef have held up relatively well inJapan since the mad cow scare in October, although this has beenattributed to early closures by processors in December and delayedopenings in January rather than a recovery in demand.
The early closures and drastic fall in beef consumption caused exportsto Japan in December to be almost 50 per cent below December 2000levels.
Burdened by the flat Japanese market, cattle prices at opening salesthis month are about 10 per cent below their December close. But cattlevalues are still 15-20 per cent above the opening rates of calendar2001.
&quot;The strong cattle price performance in the six months to December 2001suggests that earnings for the full year to June 2002 are likely toconsiderably exceed prospectus forecasts,&quot; Ms Catanzaro said.
The performance of AACo is highly exposed to beef prices and the valueof the Australian dollar.
In its July prospectus, the company said a 5 per cent swing in beefprices would have a $12.8 million impact on its earnings in the 12months to June 30, 2002. Its forecasts were based on a 3 per cent priceincrease.
The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics isexpecting saleyard prices to rise an average 7 per cent this financialyear, after a 30 per cent spike in the previous year on the back of alow dollar.
Earlier this month AACo said an anthrax outbreak in south-eastQueensland which killed 10 cattle would not affect its operationsbecause the infected cattle were far removed from AACo properties.
AACo has more than 400,000 head of cattle on 18 stations throughoutQueensland and the Northern Territory.
The company&apos;s land spans 6.5 million hectares or just under one percent of Australia&apos;s land mass.
AACo listed on the Australian Stock Exchange in August after being spunoff by Futuris Corporation but its shares have failed to trade abovethe $1 issue price since its first day on the boards.
AACo will report its results for the six months to December 2001 onFebruary 12.

AUSTRALIAN Agricultural Co, the giant cattle group run by Peter Holmes aCourt, yesterday confirmed it had been invited to stay in the hunt for itsbiggest rival, Queensland-based Stanbroke Pastoral Company owned by AMPHenderson Global Investors.
But the nation&apos;s number three cattle farmer warned there was still noguarantee it would submit a final bid for Stanbroke, despite being asked toparticipate in stage two of the sales process enabling it to completedetailed due diligence.
&quot;No agreements have yet been entered into at this stage by AACo to purchaseStanbroke, and any suggestion that AACo will make a final bid for, or be thesuccessful acquirer of Stanbroke, is entirely speculative,&quot; the companysaid.
AMP Henderson&apos;s invitation enables AACo to complete due diligence onStanbroke, which runs 500,000 cattle on its 27 cattle stations in the TopEnd. The group has been valued at up to $500 million.
Acquiring Stanbroke would give AACo a huge size advantage over its rivals.
Stanbroke&apos;s proprties cover 11.6 million hectares across the Top End. AACoruns 400,000 cattle on its 19 properties, which cover 6.5 million hectares.
In April, Mr Holmes a Court said he was &quot;very interested&quot; in the group&apos;sassets, describing Stanbroke as &quot;a well-run company, with good people, goodcattle&quot;.
But bidding could prove fierce, with competition considered likely fromnumber two cattle farmer S. Kidman &amp; Co, Kerry Packer&apos;s ConsolidatedPastoral Co, and potentially number four group, North Australian PastoralCo.
AACo yesterday also noted that continuing drought in many parts of easternAustralia, the rising Australian dollar and a reported case of mad cowdisease in Canada had helped keep a lid on cattle prices.
The drought remained the biggest problem for prices in the short term, AACosaid, as many cattle farmers had been forced to reduce their herd ahead ofwinter. Australian processors, already running at full capacity, hadsubsequently been able to offer lower prices.
In response, AACo said it had deferred some cattle sales for several weeksto take advantage of an expected rise in cattle prices from next quarter on.
Despite the reduction in cattle sales this quarter, AACo stuck by its March6 forecast that negative operating cash flows for 2002-03 should total nomore than $10 million and that it still expected a full year profit about 10per cent lower than the record $20.6 million posted last year.
Average cattle prices were also expected to rise in 2003-04, the companysaid.
AACo shares closed steady at 93 cents.

			<TEXT>In the biggest deal since it listed more than three years ago, cattle giant Australian Agricultural Company has paid $80 million for three stations and 75,000 cattle in the Northern Territory.  
The deal caps a record year for cattle property sales with more than $1 billion of stations changing hands, raising concerns the market might be overheating on the back of record high cattle prices.  
But AACo&apos;s managing director, Don Mackay, said yesterday the beef market should remain strong for another few years, notwithstanding inevitable volatility because of the Australian dollar.  
He said world supplies of cattle were limited and demand for beef was strong, particularly from North Asia. He thought it unlikely there would be a mass return to US beef when export bans imposed a year ago after the discovery of mad cow disease were eventually lifted.  
The current high prices for beef were also not ridiculously high in real terms.  
&quot;I think we&apos;ve got two to three years ahead of us,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t think people should be wringing their hands saying this is as good as it gets.&quot;  
Mr Mackay said he believed AACo had paid a reasonable price for the three new properties in the Victorian River District in the north-west of the Northern Territory.  
At around $470 per head of carrying capacity, they were well under the peak of close to $900 that had been paid for some of the properties sold this year as part of the break-up of the original Stanbroke cattle empire by its new owner, Peter Menegazzo.  
The latest acquisition totals 886,500ha and adds more than 10 per cent to AACo&apos;s existing northern Australian empire of 21 properties, seven million hectares, and 460,000 cattle.  
The aggregation - Delamere, Montejinni and Camfield stations - was bought from Texas Cattle and ~Land Co, a group of Texan investors led by prominent lawyer Walter Umphrey.  
AACo closed up 2&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; yesterday at $1.51.

			<TEXT>Beef giant Australian Agricultural Company has withstood an expected bottom line battering from drought and higher operating costs to post a 22 per cent lift in profit in the 12 months to June 30 with the promise of more to come.  
The Brisbane-based pastoral company, whose earnings are heavily reliant on movements in the cattle price, benefited from rising prices in the second half of the year to record a profit of $22.2 million. Just three months ago, the company warned in a profit downgrade growth would be closer to 15 per cent after 18 months of dry conditions in rural Australia.  
AACo chief executive officer Don Mackay, who took over from high-profile chief executive and major shareholder Peter Holmes a| Courtearlier this year, said the company had achieved a result at the top end of its forecast range despite the difficult year. He expected 2005 profit to be similar to the $22.2 million booked in 2003-04, but cash flow would be significantly higher.  
AACo said its long-term strategic decision to continue investment in its breeding herd resulted in record closing cattle inventory of 468,000, an increase of 50,000.  
Higher cattle values and a $40 million property revaluation underpinned the company&apos;s strong balance sheet and acquisition capacity.  
Revenue jumped $42.7 million to $158.7 million, with a herd increase and higher cattle prices pushing SGARA (self generating and regenerating assets) revenue up 25 per cent to $134.3 million.  
AACo said offsetting increases in cattle revenues were higher operating costs, including $2.7 million in direct costs associated with the failed Stanbroke bid and its move to exit investments in retail beef ventures.  
Mr Mackay said he was unable to comment on legal action launched by AACo in relation to the sale, which it tried to stop after alleging its higher bid had been ignored.  
The company declared a partially franked final dividend of 6&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt;~, up from a fully franked 4&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; previously. Its shares closed 2&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; higher at $1.33.

			<TEXT>Cattle group moves away from the gate-to-plate strategy of its former chief Peter Holmes a Court  
Cattle group Australian Agricultural Company has sold Jesters Jaffle Pies less than two years after buying the Perth-based gourmet pie franchising group for about $3 million.  
The sale is part of the beef empire&apos;s move away from the gate-to-plate strategy of its former chief executive Peter Holmes a| Court, which saw the cattle company invest in an upmarket Melbourne butcher, a food services joint venture to supply beef to pubs and restaurants and the Jesters pie group in a bid to maximise the value of its beef herd.  
Jesters has been bought by east coast pie chain Shakespeares Pies, which is controlled by Spike Networks chairman and Krispy Kreme Australia donut chain chief executive John McGuigan, and business partners John Atkinson and former rubgy league boss Neil Whittaker.  
The trio are also involved in Fremantle-based Little Creatures Brewing.  
The union will create Australia&apos;s biggest franchise pie business.  
While the terms of the deal were not disclosed, AACo will emerge with a 25 per cent stake in the expanded Shakespeares Pies group, which along with Krispy Kreme could form part of a fast food stable to back-door list on the stock exchange using the former dotcom Spike&apos;s still listed shell. AACo will also have a seat on the Shakespeares Pies board.  
In a statement, AACo chief executive Don Mackay said the deal would be earnings neutral with &quot;improved prospects for growth in the medium to longer term&quot;.  
The beef group has also exited the Melbourne-based Polkinghorne butchers chain afte~r the departure of Mr Holmes a| Court and has made no secret of its plans to focus on the running of its vast cattle empire rather than processing, retail and tourism ventures.  
Jesters&apos; original owners, Richard Anderson and Bill Richardson, set up the pie maker in 1997, with the first of more than 40 outlets opening in Claremont a year later.  
Known for its unique low-fat gourmet pies, Jesters has grown to 32 stores in WA and recently launched eight stores in Victoria and four in New Zealand. It receives royalty income, as well as income from the supply of cooked ingredients to the franchised stores.  
Jesters serves high-quality beef and other pies, cooked in store daily. The company has marketed itself as a healthy alternative to other fast-food outlets by using quality ingredients and ultra-thin puff pastry.  
Shakespeares Pies was established in Sydney 10 years ago, with the original store in Manly growing to a network of 15 in NSW.  
It is unclear whether AACo will continue the beef supply agreement it had with Jesters after the sale.  
In May, Mr Mackay flagged the retreat from AACos retail ventures, saying it was not a core requirement.  
&quot;If you&apos;re going to be in retail in a substantial way, you&apos;ve got to have an understanding of it and a commitment to it,&quot; he said in May while confirming the Polkinghornes roll out in Melbourne had not succeeded.  
The company, which earlier this year failed in its tender bid for Stanbroke Pastoral Co, is forecasting a 15 per cent increase in profit to $21 million for the 2003-04 year. Profit forecasts are contingent on beef prices remaining high due to the Asian ban on US imports.  
Under Mr MacKay, the emphasis has returned to breeding and production, which iswhere he has indicated the greatest potential for value-adding and profit growth lies. AACo shares closed 3&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; lower at $1.27.

The sale is part of the beef empire&apos;s move away from the gate-to-plate strategy of its former chief executive Peter Holmes a| Court, which saw the cattle company invest in an upmarket Melbourne butcher, a food services joint venture to supply beef to pubs and restaurants and the Jesters pie group in a bid to maximise the value of its beef herd.  
Jesters has been bought by east coast pie chain Shakespeares Pies, which is controlled by Spike Networks chairman and Krispy Kreme Australia donut chain chief executive John McGuigan, and business partners John Atkinson and former rubgy league boss Neil Whittaker.  
The trio are also involved in Fremantle-based Little Creatures Brewing.  
The union will create Australia&apos;s biggest franchise pie business.  
While the terms of the deal were not disclosed, AACo will emerge with a 25 per cent stake in the expanded Shakespeares Pies group, which along with Krispy Kreme could form part of a fast food stable to back-door list on the stock exchange using the former dotcom Spike&apos;s still listed shell. AACo will also have a seat on the Shakespeares Pies board.  
In a statement, AACo chief executive Don Mackay said the deal would be earnings neutral with &quot;improved prospects for growth in the medium to longer term&quot;.  
The beef group has also exited the Melbourne-based Polkinghorne butchers chain after the departure of Mr Holmes a| Court and has made no secret of its plans to focus on the running of its vast cattle empire rather than processing, retail and tourism ventures.  
Jeste~rs&apos; original owners, Richard Anderson and Bill Richardson, set up the pie maker in 1997, with the first of more than 40 outlets opening in Claremont a year later.  
Known for its unique low-fat gourmet pies, Jesters has grown to 32 stores in WA and recently launched eight stores in Victoria and four in New Zealand. It receives royalty income, as well as income from the supply of cooked ingredients to the franchised stores.  
Jesters serves high-quality beef and other pies, cooked in store daily. The company has marketed itself as a healthy alternative to other fast-food outlets by using quality ingredients and ultra-thin puff pastry.  
Shakespeares Pies was established in Sydney 10 years ago, with the original store in Manly growing to a network of 15 in NSW.  
It is unclear whether AACo will continue the beef supply agreement it had with Jesters after the sale.  
In May, Mr Mackay flagged the retreat from AACos retail ventures, saying it was not a core requirement.  
&quot;If you&apos;re going to be in retail in a substantial way, you&apos;ve got to have an understanding of it and a commitment to it,&quot; he said in May while confirming the Polkinghornes roll out in Melbourne had not succeeded.  
The company, which earlier this year failed in its tender bid for Stanbroke Pastoral Co, is forecasting a 15 per cent increase in profit to $21 million for the 2003-04 year. Profit forecasts are contingent on beef prices remaining high due to the Asian ban on US imports.  
Under Mr MacKay, the emphasis has returned to breeding and production, which iswhere he has indicated the greatest potential for value-adding and profit growth lies. AACo shares closed 3&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; lower at $1.27.

			<TEXT>CATTLE AGRICULTURE COMPANIES AUSTRALIA PROPERTY SALES QLD PASTORALISTS   
Cattle giant Australian Agricultural Company has added another big tract of country to its rural empire with the purchase of six adjoining properties in south-east Queensland for $25 million.   
But it will offset the cost with the sale of an aggregation of four properties in central Queensland, including one, Corona, it has owned since the 1880s. The Maneroo aggregation is expected to fetch between $10 million and $20 million when it is auctioned next month.   
AACo chief executive Don Mackay said yesterday the acquisitions - Wylarah, Talavera, Cadney Downs, Newington, Borah and Didgeridoo - totalled 30,400 hectares and had been negotiated with three separate vendors. They would be used for &quot;backgrounding&quot; 26,000 cattle a year, the last stage of feeding cattle on pasture before they are topped off in feedlots.   
Mr Mackay said the expansion of its backgrounding capacity would enable better market targeting of animals, increase margins and lower cattle handing costs on other stations.   
The latest acquisition follows a $50 million deal in January by AACo to acquire 58,000 cattle and a 50,613ha property, Carrum Station, at Julia Creek in Queensland.   
Mr Mackay said the new properties would be debt financed, raising the company&apos;s gearing to around 40 per cent but he expected it to be back to 30 per cent within 12 months.   
They are the first major investment since the resignation three months ago of former chief executive Peter Holmes a Court.   
Mr Mackay said AACo had not changed its profit forecast for 2003-04 of a 15 to 25 per cent rise on last year&apos;s $18.3 million. But he said beef prices had been more volatile since Christmas than they had been for years, following an improvement in seasonal conditions and the disruption to export markets flowing from the discovery of mad cow disease in the US.   
AACo runs more than 460,000 cattle over six million hectares in Queensland and the Northern Territory. Mr Mackay described seasonal conditions across the company&apos;s holdings as average.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIAN Agricultural Company management yesterday moved to reassure investors it was on track for a solid full year muster after sliding $2.9 million into the red for the first six months of the year.   
The beef group blamed higher feed costs relating to the drought, the $3.4 million it dropped on its failed attempt to buy rival cattle empire Stanbroke Pastoral Company and its exit of boutique butcher Polkinghornes, for the loss.   
Newly installed chief executive Don Mackay said the cattle group&apos;s full year earnings forecast remained unchanged despite the rocky first half, which cultimated in the sudden exit of high profile chief executive Peter Holmes a Court last month for personal reasons.   
The company says it will record a full year profit 15-25 per cent above last year&apos;s $18.3 million.   
The market was less convinced with the share price falling 4 cents to $1.28 after reaching a record high of $1.38 last week.   
AACo posted a net loss of $2.9 million compared with a profit of $3.8 million in the previous corresponding period.   
AACo said the discovery of mad cow disease in the US cattle herd had sent prices for Australian exports surging.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIAN Agricultural Co chief Peter Holmes a Court may yet have the last laugh in his attempt to get his hands on the Stanbroke beef group amid reports the consortium which trumped him with a $490 million bid is on the verge of collapse.   
Mr Holmes a Court refused to comment yesterday when asked whether he had been in talks with Hungry Jacks founder Jack Cowin, who is reportedly looking to quit his 25 per cent stake in the Stanbroke Pastoral Company after just four months.   
Speaking after a five-hour board meeting in Sydney and just before leaving for Perth, Mr Holmes a Court agreed the exit of Mr Cowin would leave the door open for AACo to snare the cream of the remaining 24 stations in the Stanbroke empire.   
He refused to comment when asked whether he had approached or had been approached by any members of the Nebo Holdings consortium which outbid AACo for Australia&apos;s biggest beef producer in September after a controversial five-month tender process.   
The most likely scenario under a break-up is for the stations to be sold separately, allowing potential buyers like AACo to pick the properties it wants at less than the $500 million it was prepared to pay for the Stanbroke group in its entirety.   
News of disarray in the Nebo camp came a day after AACo announced it had splashed out $50 million for two Queensland cattle properties and 58,000 head of cattle from a Brazilian investor.   
Mr Holmes a Court said the acquisitions showed there were properties &quot;under the radar&quot; which would allow AACo to fulfil its expansion plans, despite being the under bidder for Stanbroke.   
He said the deal would be debt funded but did not rule out going to the market to raise equity &quot;at the right time&quot;.   
Mr Holmes a Court almost managed to derail the sale process to Nebo after AACo sought an injunction in the Federal Court to stop the sale.   
The court heard allegations of collusion between Nebo investor Peter Hughes - a former Stanbroke director - and Stanbroke seller AMP before finding there were no grounds to stop the sale. Mr Hughes was cleared of any wrongdoing.   
AACo has a damages claim against AMP and could still lodge a claim for loss of income.   
One reason given for Nebo&apos;s bid being accepted by AMP was that it intended to keep the 27-station empire intact, yet a month later it put four stations up for sale.   
It managed to sell three properties for $52 million but said no further disposals of Stanbroke stations were planned.   
Other members of the Nebo consortium include media-shy Victorian potato farmer Peter Menegazzo, who holds 50 per cent, and Queensland grazier Peter Hughes who holds a 25 per cent stake with three other Queensland rural families.   
AACo&apos;s share price closed unchanged at $1.26 yesterday.

			<TEXT>AMP  
REDUCE  
Few positive triggers exist that would lead to a re-rating of AMP (AMP) by the market, according to Bell Potter Securities.  
The broker lifted its first half estimate on earnings per share by 3 per cent to 19.8&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; a share.  
Its full year estimates were also revised upwards, by 7 per cent, while the 2005-06 earnings per share estimates rose 3 per cent.  
Despite this the broker said the financial services group&apos;s current values were expensive. AMP had underperformed the S&amp;P-ASX 200 by 10.3 per cent in the year to date,  
The broker set a target of $6.40. AMP put on 11&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; to close at $6.88.  
AUSTRALIAN AGRICULTURAL COMPANY  
REDUCE  
A positive first half performance for Australian Agricultural Company (AAC) was undermined by seasonal uncertainty and moves by Japan to lift its ban on US beef imports, which could threaten prices.  
Hartleys released a &quot;reduce&quot; rating on the company after its first half results, which compared the half to last December rather than last June.  
Comparing the 2005 June half to the previous June half resulted in a 74 per cent fall in net profit after tax and earnings per share.  
The broker said AACo largely overcame the drought to perform well. The group lifted its single annual dividend to 7&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt;, only 20 per cent franked.  
AACo added 1&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; to finish at $1.79.  
ALINTA  
ADD  
Optimistic first half expectations for Alinta (ALN) have been buoyed by an earnings upgrade driven by the Duke acquisition and positive spin-offs of the IFRS accounting policy.  
Alinta will release its first half 2005 results on August 17 and ABN AMRO said the market&apos;s focus would be on the impending Duke Energy spin-off from last year~&apos;s $1.7 billion deal, and the future home of the sales proceeds.  
LPG prices and organic growth should also ensure a solid result, according to the broker, who forecast a first half net profit after tax of $43 million and an interim dividend of 16&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; a share.  
The broker maintained its &quot;add&quot; rating, and increased its valuation and target price by 25&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; to $10.25.  
Its only concern regarding the Duke deal was that existing cash balances would probably have to prop up the dividend until new returns manifested.  
This indicated a limited upside to Alinta&apos;s sector-low yield of 4.5 per cent.  
Alinta rose 8&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; yesterday to $9.90.  
COCA-COLA AMATIL  
OUTPERFORM  
Coca-Cola Amatil (CCL) was well positioned to outperform in the Australian market, with new product launches, price growth and economic improvement in Indonesia placing it in good stead for a strong second half of 2005.  
Credit Suisse First Boston said Coca-Cola&apos;s first half profit after tax of $145 million, a rise of 16.8 per cent, was in line with expectations.  
It expected an acceleration of NPAT in the second half of the year, to 19.4 per cent.  
Share price movement would coincide with second half 2005 earnings momentum.  
CCL shares rose 35&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; to $8.48.

			<TEXT>AMP  
REDUCE  
Few positive triggers exist that would lead to a re-rating of AMP (AMP) by the market, according to Bell Potter Securities.  
The broker lifted its first half estimate on earnings per share by 3 per cent to 19.8&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; a share.  
Its full year estimates were also revised upwards, by 7 per cent, while the 2005-06 earnings per share estimates rose 3 per cent.  
Despite this the broker said the financial services group&apos;s current values were expensive. AMP had underperformed the S&amp;P-ASX 200 by 10.3 per cent in the year to date,  
The broker set a target of $6.40. AMP put on 11&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; to close at $6.88.  
AUSTRALIAN AGRICULTURAL COMPANY  
REDUCE  
A positive first half performance for Australian Agricultural Company (AAC) was undermined by seasonal uncertainty and moves by Japan to lift its ban on US beef imports, which could threaten prices.  
Hartleys released a &quot;reduce&quot; rating on the company after its first half results, which compared the half to last December rather than last June.  
Comparing the 2005 June half to the previous June half resulted in a 74 per cent fall in net profit after tax and earnings per share.  
The broker said AACo largely overcame the drought to perform well. The group lifted its single annual dividend to 7&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt;, only 20 per cent franked.  
AACo added 1&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; to finish at $1.79.  
ALINTA  
ADD  
Optimistic first half expectations for Alinta (ALN) have been buoyed by an earnings upgrade driven by the Duke acquisition and positive spin-offs of the IFRS accounting policy.  
Alinta will release its first half 2005 results on August 17 and ABN AMRO said the market&apos;s focus would be on the impending Duke Energy spin-off from last year&apos;s $1.7 billion deal, and the future home of the sales proceeds.  
LPG prices and organic growth should also ensure a solid result, according to the broker, who forecast a first half net profit after tax~ of $43 million and an interim dividend of 16&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; a share.  
The broker maintained its &quot;add&quot; rating, and increased its valuation and target price by 25&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; to $10.25.  
Its only concern regarding the Duke deal was that existing cash balances would probably have to prop up the dividend until new returns manifested.  
This indicated a limited upside to Alinta&apos;s sector-low yield of 4.5 per cent.  
Alinta rose 8&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; yesterday to $9.90.  
COCA-COLA AMATIL  
OUTPERFORM  
Coca-Cola Amatil (CCL) was well positioned to outperform in the Australian market, with new product launches, price growth and economic improvement in Indonesia placing it in good stead for a strong second half of 2005.  
Credit Suisse First Boston said Coca-Cola&apos;s first half profit after tax of $145 million, a rise of 16.8 per cent, was in line with expectations.  
It expected an acceleration of NPAT in the second half of the year, to 19.4 per cent.  
Share price movement would coincide with second half 2005 earnings momentum.  
CCL shares rose 35&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; to $8.48.

			<TEXT>Investors bale out on horror harvest fears for Eastern States farmers   
Growing fears that eastern Australia is headed for another severe drought triggered a fresh investor exodus from agribusiness stocks yesterday despite claims the market may be over-reacting to the threat.   
Among the hardest hit stocks yesterday were cattle giant Australian Agricultural Company, which lost 6.2 per cent or 9&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; to close at a seven-month low of $1.36 and Futuris Corporation, parent of Elders farm services network, which fell 5.4 per cent or 10&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; to an eight-month low $1.75. Both companies have now slipped around 20 per cent in the past two weeks.   
But the rout extended to almost all the stocks whose short-term fortunes are linked to the grain crop due to to be planted in the next few weeks, including exporters ABB Grain and AWB and agricultural chemical manufacturer Nufarm.   
AWB, which also owns the Landmark farm services business, slumped to a 19-month low of $3.98 before recovering to close down 4&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; at $4.16, or a 17 per cent drop in the past month.   
East cost grain handling and storage giant GrainCorp appeared to provide the trigger for yesterday&apos;s sell-down when it added to the swath of profit downgrades that have hit corporate Australia in recent weeks.   
GrainCorp slumped $1.10 to $11.50 after it revised its profit forecast for 2004-05 to $10 to $12 million, lopping $4 million from the previous range.   
The downgrade largely reflected last season&apos;s summer and winter harvests rather than the future crop but appeared to focus further unfavourable attention on the sector.   
The worstening seasonal outlook in the eastern states was spotlighted earlier this week by the Bureau of Meteorology which reported the first four months of the year had been among the hottest and d~riest on record.   
It also put the prospects this year of an El Nino, the climatic phenomenon linked to loweer than average in Australia, at 30 to 50 per cent, or around double what would normally be expected at this time of the year.   
The gathering gloom in the east appears to have overshadowed the much more promising outlook in WA, which is enjoying its best start to a cropping season in more than five years thanks to the heavy rain across most of the south west last weekend.   
Many of the companies affected by yesterday&apos;s investor exodus said the weather situation needed to be kept in perspective with another four to six weeks to go before the planting season would be late, shrinking the area sown and yields.   
Robert Reis, the corporate affairs manager of Nufarm, which makes around 40 per cent of its herbicide sales in Australia, said it saw no reason uet to revise its earnings guidance.   
&quot;It&apos;s not unusual to find ourselves in this position at this time of the year,&quot; he said.   
The managing director of Elders Greg Hunt said that while it had been a hot dry start to the year, the outlook for the cropping season was no worse that had been this time a year ago. &quot;I am praying but not panicking,&quot; he said. The managing director of Australian Agricultural Company, Don Mackay, said the group was relatively unaffected by the dry start to the season in southern half of Australia.   
He said it appeared to be being caught up in the growing negative sentiment towards agricultural stocks and some nervousness about the cattle market, which it also believed was overplayed.   
&quot;It&apos;s unfortunate the market has developed a herd mentality, if you&apos;ll excuse the pun,&quot; he said.   
The managing director of Australian Wheat Forecasters, Brian Bailey, said the outlook for the coming cropping season in eastern Australia was worstening but there was still some time before the situation became critical.   
He recently marginally downgraded his forecast for the upcoming wheat crop to 24.2 million tonnes, but that would st~ill be one of the biggest on record.   
The rural stocks were among the hardest hit in another nervous day for investors.

			<TEXT>The strong Australian dollar has had a mixed impact on Australia&apos;s sharemarket during its record-breaking performance.  
But importers have notched up the biggest currency gains, even with the market recently losing some of its shine and the dollar down 3.5 per cent from its high.  
In general terms, a strong currency is seen as positive for importers and negative for exporters. But a lot of big Australian companies have significant offshore exposure which means that a rising Australian dollar hurts their earnings when they are repatriated.  
Heather Zampatti, of Bell Potter Securities, says the strong Australian dollar has benefited retailers that import goods, such as Housewares International.  
But strength in the dollar has had an adverse impact on exporters such as resource companies BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto as well as wine maker Southcorp and cattle producer Australian Agricultural Company.  
&quot;If the dollar is strong they lose a lot of their competitive edge because their products are more expensive overseas,&quot; Ms Zampatti said.  
On the other side of the ledger, a weak dollar is generally good for tourism-based companies.  
David Mozina, ABN AMRO&apos;s head of foreign exchange and fixed income strategy, sees a number of themes weighing on the Australian dollar, which he expects to be trading at around US70&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; by the end of 2005, down from its current level of US77&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt;.  
&quot;Renewed US dollar buying is coming back, interest rate differentials are continuing to narrow with the US and, with a stronger US dollar, commodity prices are becoming more capped,&quot; he said.  
&quot;The global investor community is slowly becoming more wary of the likelihood of continuing equity market gains and the level of global risk has risen significantly over the past few weeks, borne out by ~a weaker US equity market which has set the scene globally.&quot;  
Another factor filtering into Australia is the profit downgrade announced by General Motors earlier in March.  
The world&apos;s biggest car maker warned of a first quarter loss, rattling confidence in the US corporate bond market and adding to market jitters.  
With the GM announcement coinciding with a US rate rise, Mr Mozina said markets have started to unwind commodity, equity and Australian dollar positions that have performed well over the past few years.  
&quot;A large chunk of the speculative market have taken some profits off the table,&quot; he said.  
Because of the significant gains made by the Australian dollar in the past year, Troy Angus, portfolio manager at BT Financial Group, says it&apos;s likely to be less of a challenge for investors in 2005 than in past years.  
&quot;The dollar is now where it was in December 2004 and in February 2004 and I think a lot of the sharp moves are over and I believe it will be an easier investment decision to manage going forward.&quot;  
As for strategies to manage a currency shift, Mr Angus believes there is little investors in the domestic equity need to do to immunise their portfolio from a rising Australian dollar other than having a fully diversified portfolio.  
&quot;But investors in international equities who are concerned about the Australian dollar should probably consider hedging the Australian dollar out of their portfolio,&quot; he said.  
He lists Pacific Brands and Coles Myer among the companies that he believes will benefit from a strong dollar.  
Currencies tend to trade on interest rate differentials and tracking foreign exchange markets requires intensive monitoring, making it a notoriously hard task for individuals.  
According to Dennis Barton, the director of Andep Investment Consultantancy, managed funds are an effective way for investors to benefit from currency gains while also getting overseas stock selection.  
&quot;It&apos;s hard to pick currency movements but when you see evidence of the Australia~n dollar falling, that&apos;s the time to move overseas,&quot; he said.  
Gerry Pauley, the WA chairman of the Australian Shareholders&apos; Association, points out that an American investor who 3 1/2| years ago bought a $US1000 basket of Australian stocks that performed in line with our all-ordinaries index would have a portfolio worth around $US2400 today - an appreciation of 140 per cent.  
&quot;But Australians who invested in US stocks during that time would be mindful of the fact that the slope on the downside can be just as steep and nowhere near as pleasant.  
When the party ends in Australia, both our currency and our stockmarket could fall together, doubling the bad news on the downside,&quot; he said.  
Chris Craggs, a certified financial planner and a senior consultant at Godfrey Pembroke, is not expecting the strong dollar to be a major factor for sharemarket investors this year.  
&quot;When making overseas investments I select fund managers who hedge their portfolios to offset the currency risk,&quot; he said.

HOLD  
Broker ABN AMRO Morgans said Futuris&apos; (FCL) interim profit indicated it had performed well over the past six months and a number of growth projects and investments should deliver over the next 12 months. But it maintained a hold on the stock because it said the recent rise in its share price had already rewarded those initiatives.  
It said Elders continued to improve in the first half due to stronger market conditions and new business initiatives, with solid performances from insurance, meat and livestock and Australian Agricultural Company. But the second half was critical and highly contingent on rainfall.  
Futuris added 6&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; to $2.31.  
RURAL PRESS  
SHORT TERM: MARKET  
PERFORM; LONG TERM: HOLD  
Rural Press (RUP) is well positioned to benefit from mooted changes to Australia&apos;s media ownership laws, according to stockbroker Goldman Sachs JBWere.  
Rural Press announced net profit after tax had grown 30 per cent in the half year to $54.7 million, supported by earnings growth from its regional newspaper and printing operations.  
The company also announced a second, interim dividend of 6&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; in addition to its normal interim dividend of 13&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt;.  
The broker said it retained its forecast for a drop in advertising revenue growth out to 2007 which could see earnings per share momentum slow substantially.  
However, the broker said 5 per cent yield should see the stock supported at current levels and it has retained its recommendation. Rural Press eased 10&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; to $10.60.  
ADELAIDE BRIGHTON  
HOLD, HIGH RISK  
Adelaide Brighton&apos;s (ABC) full year net profit after tax came in ahead of expectations but Smith Barney Citigroup said managemen~t seemed somewhat cautious in regard to the scope for further pricing gains.  
The broker said the $67.5 million result was underpinned by stronger performances from the Cement &amp; Lime business.  
Earnings growth over the next two to three years is expected to flow from capital initiatives at the Hartley Quarry, expansion of the WA lime operations and an upgrade at Port Kembla.  
Smith Barney Citigroup said AdBri appeared to be trading at a significant premium to its peers but its earnings profile supported the price and it retained its recommendation. Adelaide Brighton fell 8&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; to $1.73.  
HARDMAN RESOURCES  
ACCUMULATE  
Hardman (HDR) is the most leveraged of the three listed Australian players in Mauritania but with an exploration program scheduled to start in the middle this year, Intersuisse has maintained its accumulate rating on the stock.  
The broker said development of the Chinguetti project was on-track to hit production in the first quarter of 2006. Initially the project will consist of six production wells. The exploration partners agreed to a sixth water injector well and Hardman secured a $US100 million ($128 million) project facility which will be used to cover 80 per cent of its costs.  
Hardman has a 19.01 per cent holding in the project and its shares added 1&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; to $1.87.

			<TEXT>Two of Australia&apos;s most prominent corporate cattle barons have dismissed speculation they are in the hunt to buy a huge beef holding in WA which is on the market for $110 million, a price tag set to blitz the record for the State&apos;s most expensive farm transaction.  
The country&apos;s biggest cattle producer, Australian Agricultural Company, and one of its fastest growing, Great Southern Plantations, both said they were not pursuing the purchase of Lyndon and Bruce Brown&apos;s Wagyu beef operation.  
The business was put on the market nearly two months ago and includes 20,000 Wagyu cattle and 27,189 hectares of land around Eneabba and Badgingarra between Perth and Geraldton.  
The Browns were among the earliest in Australia to start breeding Wagyus, which produce the heavily fat-marbled beef for which Japanese consumers pay a small fortune.  
Queensland-based AACo expanded its involvement in Wagyu breeding in March via a $10 million deal to buy Westholme Wagyu, then based in NSW and the biggest purebred herd outside Japan.  
But an AACo representative said it was not in the market to buy the holding in WA, where it currently has no other properties.  
Great Southern has been one of the most aggressive buyers of prominent cattle properties in Australia in the past year after expanding its tax-effective agricultural investment schemes to cattle.  
In the first half of this year it spent more than $100 million in less than three months on cattle properties. They included the purchase of Wrotham Park station in Queensland from AACo for $53.5 million, another Queensland station, Chudleigh Park, for $28.5 million and one of WA&apos;s biggest cattle stations, Moola Bulla, for around $30 million.  
But a Great Southern spokesman said it too was not pursuing the $110 million Wagyu property.  
Agent John Ga~rland said it had had interest from a number of other prospective buyers.

			<TEXT>Holmes a| Court family company Heytesbury has continued to capitalise on buoyant asset prices by selling its waterfront East Perth head office.  
The three-level building, which has views across the Swan River and the Burswood Peninsula from the Claisebrook Inlet, has been sold to a private investor for an undisclosed sum.  
The confidential deal comes just five months after Heytesbury sold two of its Northern Territory cattle stations - Anthony Lagoon and Eva Downs - to Australian Agricultural Co for $97 million.  
However, Heytesbury chief executive Paul Holmes a| Court said Heytesbury was simply cashing in on strong asset prices and had no immediate plans to reinvest the money with another acquisition.  
&quot;There&apos;s not a lot of opportunities screaming out,&quot; he said.  
Mr Holmes a| Court added that Heytesbury had negotiated with the new owner to lease back its office space in the East Perth building for four years.  
&quot;The (Perth office) market is very strong,&quot; Mr Holmes a| Courtsaid. &quot;And as long as you&apos;ve got your own accommodation stitched up you can afford to look at assets from a purely commercial perspective, which is what we&apos;ve done.&quot;  
Known as The Gallery, the Heytesbury building has about 1500 square metres of lettable office space. It houses the Holmes a| Court art gallery, a restaurant operated by Kate Lamont and the offices of Snap Franchising and lawyer Kim Wilson &amp; Co.  
The Holmes a| Court building was one of the first prominent developments in East Perth when it opened more than six years ago.  
The development included 24 apartments in an adjoining building which were sold off the plan to investors for up to $1.2 million each.  
The move to East Perth from the AMP Building in St Georges Terrace was part of the downsizing of the Heytesbury empire, which had been selling off assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars - including the Sto~ll Moss theatre chain in London - to reduce debt after the death of patriarch Robert Holmes a| Court in 1990.  
The Holmes a| Court family still owns six cattle stations, the Vasse Felix winery, the Heytesbury thoroughbred stud, artwork and a one per cent shareholding in the John Holland construction group which Janet Holmes a| Court chairs.  
&quot;We&apos;re just boring farmers these days,&quot; Mr Holmes a| Court said.

			<TEXT>Futuris Corporation is again testing the patience of its shareholders after its share price slumped 7 per cent yesterday to a 16-month low on the back of a downgrade in its forecast profit for this year.  
Futuris chairman Stephen Gerlach told the annual meeting in Adelaide yesterday that the company was only likely to achieve the lower end of brokers&apos; forecasts for 2006-07 because of the impact of drought on its core rural operations. And that relied on a favourable combination of good rainfall to kick off the new cropping season next year, improved sales by its timber plantation investment subsidiary ITC, and reasonable cattle prices which would affect the reported contribution from its 40 per cent stake in cattle giant Australian Agricultural Co.  
Mr Gerlach nominated the existing range of brokers&apos; net profit forecasts for 2006-07 as between $88 million and $113 million.  
&quot;The lower half is achievable,&quot; he said, indicating its result might only be flat on its underlying earnings for the year to last June of $88.3 million. Previous consensus forecasts have put the figure at $103.8 million.  
Mr Gerlach said the first half was likely to be below last year because of the season&apos;s deterioration which had hit merchandise and fertiliser sales by its Elders farm services network.  
&quot;Some operations such as livestock and real estate have had positive starts to the year but stand to be affected by the impact of extended dry conditions,&quot; he said.  
Futuris shares fell 13.5&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; yesterday to $1.74, their lowest level since June last year and a 25 per cent fall in the past eight months.  
Futuris managing director Les Wozniczka said it remained committed to its strategy of re-orientating the company around its rural and regional businesses. &quot;Looking ahead we believe that the company is capable of doing even better over the next five years from our existing asset base and areas of~ interest,&quot; he said.  
Mr Gerlach also announced recently retired NAB senior executive Ian MacDonald would join the board.

			<TEXT>COLES MYER  
SELL  
Stockbroker ABN AMRO has retained its sell recommendation on Coles Myer, despite last week&apos;s initiatives, which included plans to revamp Kmart under a new name.  
&quot;We believe its recent $300 million provision for restructuring, our forecast of flat earnings growth in 2006-07 and uncertainty with regard to the execution of its supply chain initiatives are likely to see the stock underperform,&quot; the broker said.  
ABN AMRO said that while Coles Myer seemed committed to the Kmart business, albeit under its new name, the department store arm could yet be sold off, like Myer, if earnings did not improve.  
&quot;The returns are not much higher than those of Myer, and therefore must improve to remain worthy of retention,&quot; ABN said.  
The broker has a target price of $10.20 on Coles Myer shares, which closed at $11.10, up 28&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt;.  
AUSTRALIAN AGRICULTURAL COMPANY  
SELL  
Australian Agricultural Company (AAC), the country&apos;s biggest cattle manager, is still only for the true believers and those investors comfortable with agricultural risk, Aspect Huntley said.  
The research house estimates earnings per share growth of 16.9 per cent for AAC this calendar year, falling to 13.3 per cent in 2007. AAC on Thursday announced a 27 per cent increase in interim profit to $8.5 million, aided by asset sales.  
Risks to its share price include the lifting of Japan&apos;s ban on US beef imports.  
&quot;AAC only pays a final unfranked dividend, so is more suited to growth investors comfortable with agricultural risk,&quot; AAC said.  
AAC shares slipped 7&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; to $1.78.  
BILLABONG INTERNATIONAL  
HOLD, HIGH RISK  
Broker Citigroup has cut its earnings forecasts for Billabong Inte~rnational (BBG) because of expected deterioration in its key retail markets of Australia and the US, which account for nearly 75 per cent of profit.  
The broker tipped Billabong could cut its usual earnings guidance of 15 per cent growth when it releases its 2005-06 profit on August 22. It forecasts earnings per share growth of just 8 per cent for 2006-07.  
Citigroup cut its profit forecasts for 2006-07 and 2007-08 by 6 per cent and reduced Billabong&apos;s price target to $15.25 from $16.15. &quot;We still maintain a positive long-term view about Billabong&apos;s international expansion and new product development,&quot; it said.  
Billabong fell 73&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; to $13.09.  
COCA-COLA AMATIL  
NEUTRAL  
Stockbroker Bell Potter expects Coca-Cola Amatil (CCL) shares to remain weak in the short-term, given weak investor sentiment after successive profit downgrades.  
The drinks maker on Thursday cut its annual profit forecast as it announced a 21 per cent fall in interim profit.  
Bell Potter said it had lowered its expected 2006 profit for CCA by 5 per cent and reduced its forecasts for 2007 and 2008 by about 9 per cent.  
&quot;Asian profits have proved volatile and difficult to predict and deserve lower multiples,&quot; the broker said. It slashed its price target to $6.18 from $7.13.

			<TEXT>A controversial land-buying spree by agricultural investment companies is continuing with Great Southern Plantations snapping up another landmark cattle station for $53.5 million, one of the biggest single rural property deals ever done in Australia.   
Cattle giant Australian Agricultural Company announced yesterday that it had sold one of its most well-known properties, Wrotham Park, 300km west of Cairns in Queensland, to GSP.   
The sale includes just under 600,000ha of land and more than 40,000 brahman cattle.   
The move means GSP has spent more than $100 million on cattle properties in less than three months and continues its rapid elevation into the ranks of Australia&apos;s biggest cattle owners.   
In March, it acquired one of WA&apos;s biggest cattle stations Moola Bulla, near Halls Creek, with 35,000 cattle for around $30 million and a month later bought another Queensland station, Chudleigh Park, west of Townsville, for $28.5 million, including 18,000 cattle.   
But the sale is also likely to compound growing tension in rural Australia over the recent aggressive expansion by managers of tax-effective agricultural investment schemes beyond their tree farming roots into mainstream agricultural pursuits such as horticulture and cattle.   
Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran revealed this week the Government had begun a separate investigation into the impact of managed investment schemes on mainstream agriculture.   
That is on top of an existing Treasury review of tax rules applying to investments in timber plantations, which has proposed a number of changes, including a $6500-a-hectare cap on the amount investors can claim as a deduction in one year but extending the deadline that managers have to spend the money from 12 months to 18 months.   
Mr McGauran said he accepted investors in MIS projects, other than timber, got no special tax incentives over other primary ~producers.   
But he said the big licks of capital that MIS companies had available for land acquisitions and expansion gave them a different capability to traditional farmers.   
GSP corporate affairs manager David Ikin pointed out its latest acquisition was a corporate-to-corporate swap and did not impact on any family farmers. He reiterated it was under extreme pressure from shareholders and investors not to pay over-the-top prices for land.   
AACo chief executive officer Don Mackay said he had no concern about the expansion of MIS companies into beef.   
&quot;It&apos;s an industry that can always benefit from large players who can bring capital into it,&quot; he said.   
Mr Mackay said Wrotham Park was an outstanding property but was distant from AACo&apos;s other major properties and no longer fitted with its focus on higher value branded beef production.   
GSP&apos;s acquisition does not include the $1200-a-night luxury tourism resort on Wrotham Park which opened around two years ago and is sub-leased and operated by Voyages, an arm of GPT property group.   
Mr Mackay said AACo would maintain its small interest in the tourism operation, which it held through its Authentic Outback Experience joint venture with bush outfitter RM Williams.

			<TEXT>In its first major asset sale for several years, the Holmes a| Court private company, Heytesbury, has sold some of its northern cattle empire for nearly $100 million amid a boom in beef property prices.  
But Heytesbury chief executive Paul Holmes a| Court said the sale of two stations in the Northern Territory to fellow cattle giant Australian Agricultural Company was not part of any wider plan to exit the industry.  
It did not have any immediate plans for the $97 million AACo has agreed to pay for Anthony Lagoon and Eva Downs stations, including 936,000 hectares of land and 62,000 cattle.  
But if the opportunity arose it would look to buy more cattle properties closer to its remaining six cattle stations and around 150,000 cattle.  
It was also keen to expand its Vasse Felix wine business, now the only other main arm of the Heytesbury group, despite the bleak conditions in the industry.  
&quot;The market is pretty awful but we are long term investors and we think things are likely to pop up,&quot; Mr Holmes a| Court said. &quot;We have got nothing in mind at the moment but we are keen on expanding in that sector.&quot;  
He said it had recently bought another 50ha of land close to its existing Margaret River operations which it intended to plant to vines.  
The latest acquisitions by AACo cement its rank as Australia&apos;s biggest cattle producer and take it further towards its target of having one million cattle within a decade.  
AACo managing director Don Mackay said Heytesbury had approached it to see if it was interested in Eva Downs and Anthony Lagoon, which are adjacent to AACo&apos;s Brunette Downs and Rockhampton Downs stations.  
They would take AACo&apos;s portfolio to 29 stations and around 600,000 cattle, although it was also prepared to sell properties which do~ not fit into its production strategies, including the impending auction of Wrotham Park west of Cairns.  
Heytesbury has sold few major assets since the huge decade-long disposal program forced on Paul Holmes a| Court&apos;s mother, Heytesbury chairman Janet, following his father Robert&apos;s death in 1990, to rid the company of crushing debt.  
Mr Holmes a| Court said it was now fairly conservatively geared.  
He said it had elected to sell Eva Downs and Anthony Lagoon, near the Queensland border, because they were more suited to producers who had other properties in Queensland and could use them in an integrated production system where breeding cattle were located at one site and their offspring moved south for fattening.  
Its remaining stations, which include Victoria River Downs in the NT, were focused on live cattle exports to Asia.  
He said Vasse Felix was performing well despite the troubled landscape in the wine industry, including the problems besetting its debt-laden near-neighbour Evans &amp; Tate.  
&quot;We are very conscious of the oversupplied nature of the market but we are having a good year,&quot; he said.

			<TEXT>Elders Rural Bank has fought off fierce competition to deliver further growth in its earnings, loans, deposits and share of the $34 billion rural lending market.  
The bank, a joint venture between Elders and Bendigo Bank, yesterday posted a net profit of $13.2 million for the six months to December 31, a 17 per cent jump on the previous corresponding period.  
The result will feed into the half year result today of Elders&apos; parent, Futuris Corporation, which has foreshadowed 10 to 25 per cent growth in it underlying earnings for the full year over last year&apos;s $70.6 million.  
Chief executive Bob Jones said margins had declined from 3.58 per cent to 3.2 per cent in the past six months. But the bank was on track to continue the double-digit annual earnings growth it had achieved since it was created more than five years ago.  
Meanwhile, another branch of Futuris&apos; family of agricultural investments - 42 per cent-owned cattle giant Australian Agricultural Company - yesterday flagged plans to make an exploratory move into Brazil&apos;s huge cattle industry.  
AACo managing director Don Mackay said its management consultancy, RMP, was hoping to strike a deal to manage a big operation in Brazil in the next six months.  
The company did not believe it was wise yet to invest capital in Brazil but it wanted a better understanding of the world&apos;s biggest beef exporting nation.  
AACo also confirmed plans to double the size of its cattle herd over the next decade to one million head, the first time it has openly revisited that ambition since former chief executive Peter Holmes a Court left two years ago.  
The latest outline of its plans for growth coincided with AACo reporting an expected $16.8 million profit for the year to December 31, down around half largely because of difficult seasonal conditions.  
A third Futuris branch, 53 per cent owned Integrated Tree Cropping, yesterday repo~rted a near-flat half year profit of $6.3 million.  
Growth at its plantation investment business was dragged down by a $2 million slump in earnings from timber processing, which was hit by the east coast housing downturn.

			<TEXT>SPOTLIGHT   
Shares in Australian Agricultural Company jumped another 10 per cent yesterday amid predictions there would be strong local and foreign interest in the 43 per cent stake in the cattle giant just put up for sale by Futuris Corporation.   
Credit Suisse said AACo was one of the most strategic listed agricultural plays in Australia, holding the countrys biggest beef herd and a portfolio of 24 properties which would be difficult to replicate.   
It said the wording of Futuris announcement on Tuesday indicated it intended to sell its entire stake to a single buyer, delivering an opportunity to the acquirer to bid for the whole group. It predicted a trade buyer should be comfortable paying $3.25 a share, compared with yesterdays close of $3.08.   
&quot;We believe there will be keen interest in the company from domestic and especially international players,&quot; it said.   
ABN AMRO Morgans analyst Belinda Moore said Futuris decision to appoint Citigroup and Caliburn to conduct a global sales process meant the company was now in play.   
&quot;We believe there will be strong interest in the sale process globally, as AACo is an irreplaceable asset,&quot; she said.   
Ms Moore said it was uncertain whether Futuris would sell its entire stake to a strategic buyer, whether that buyer would launch a full takeover bid or whether the stock would be placed in the market.   
But the greatest value proposition for any buyer would be to buy the whole group and then break the properties up for sale, in line with the highly profitable dispersal of the former Stanbroke beef empire after it was sold by AMP three years ago to a syndicate of investors for $490 million.   
She believed any takeover bid would need to be at least $3.77 a share, reflecting a 20 per cent control premium to her sum-of-the-parts valuation of $3.14.   
Tim Hornibrook, a director of the new Macquarie Pastoral Fund, which is aiming to buy up to $1 billion of livestock properties, said he could neither confirm nor deny its interest.   
Futuris spokesman Don Murchland yesterday defended the timing of the sale which is believed to have surprised AACo, coming after a 25 per cent fall in its share price since early August as cattle prices have fallen. He said buyers would not value AACo on short-term factors.   
He said Futuris has no specific target for the money raised. But even if it was used to repay debt, for example $140 million in convertible notes due to redeemed in December, it would be positive for earnings because of the low return it was getting from its AACo stake, only around $5 million in unfranked dividends last year.   
Futuris shares yesterday lost nearly half the previous days gain, closing down 5&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; at $2.05.

			<TEXT>Cattle companys share price jumps 30&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; on sale news   
Australias biggest cattle owner,  Australian Agricultural Company, has come into play suddenly after its biggest shareholder,  Futuris Corporation, announced plans to sell its 43 per cent stake in the company.   
AACos shares shot up 30&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; to $2.80 yesterday on the back of the move but the timing is believed to have surprised its board and senior management, coming after a 25 per cent slide in its share price since early August.   
The sellout comes just over six years after Futuris floated off AACo, its then boss Alan Newman appointing Peter Holmes a Court as chief executive to sell the then unfashionable company to investors at $1 a share.   
Its capitalisation has since grown from $185 million to yesterdays close of $718 million, while its cattle herd has jumped from 348,000 head to 631,000 head. They occupy a string of 24 cattle stations across the Northern Territory and Queensland totalling just under eight million hectares, or 1.2 per cent of Australias land mass.   
Futuris chief executive Les Wozniczka said AACo was &quot;a wonderful asset&quot; but the board had decided to sell out because AACos value was not being recognised in Futuris share price. It was better off reinvesting the proceeds elsewhere.   
Futuris $300 million investment in AACo has long been held up as part of its farm-to-consumer integration strategy but it contributed just $5.2 million to earnings last year.   
Futuris chairman Stephen Gerlach said the lowly return, excluding unrealised share price gains, was one it could not sustain. &quot;We ourselves do not get any credit for the growth in the value of the properties that underlie AACo,&quot; he said.   
Mr Wozniczka could not be contacted but the AACo sale may have been influenced by Futuris being due in December to repay $150 million of convertible notes paying 7 per cent on their 1999 issue price of $2.40.   
Futuris shares rose 11.5&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; yesterday to $2.10 but remain little better than eight years ago. Its latest move continues major change over the past year, including the retirement of founding directors Alan Newman and Walter Johnson, an exodus of executives from its Elders subsidiary and a big move into rural telecommunications.   
It is unclear yet whether Futuris will sell the AACo stake as a whole, with anyone acquiring 20 per cent or more likely to be obliged by law to make a takeover offer. It has appointed  Citigroup and Caliburn to conduct a global sale process to &quot;realise appropriate value&quot;, but analysts said the sale of a controlling stake almost certainly would reap most reward.   
One adviser said he was surprised Futuris had opted not to engineer a break-up of AACo, which could realise far more based on the carve-up of the Stanbroke empire three years ago. It should interest local and offshore investors, including Macquarie Banks new pastoral fund, which had targeted to invest up to $1 billion.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIAN AGRICULTURAL HOLD   
Goldman Sachs JBWere has upgraded  Australian Agricultural Company (AAC) to hold from sell and cut its price target after the pull-back in the companys share price.   
&quot;Our revised share price target plus a 12-month dividend represent a total return of 16.7 per cent against GSJBWs forecast market return of 15.2 per cent,&quot; the broker said. &quot;We remain concerned about currency-related risk and that cattle prices may weaken if US beef gains traction in Asian markets.&quot; The price target was cut to $2.86 from $3.09.   
AACo shares jumped 23&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; to $2.73.   
GPT GROUP BUY   
Merrill Lynch says  GPT Group (GPT) made positive strides in the June half with a new development/funds model, enhancing its development pipeline to $4.2 billion from $3 billion, but warns of the impact of higher interest rates.   
&quot;While the yields and speculative nature of the projects are risky, GPTs exposure is mitigated through co-ownership with its funds, which have balance sheet strength,&quot; the broker said.   
However, although GPTs balance sheet was only 32 per cent geared, &quot;the expiration profile concerns us given the credit market conditions and GPTs weighted averaged debt duration of only 2.1 years&quot;.   
In the near term GPT has $1.6 billion due within 12 months and $2.8 billion in two to five years.   
&quot;We are assuming GPT refinances at higher rates, and are forecasting its 5.1 per cent current weighted average interest rises about 50 basis points over the next 12 months,&quot; the broker said.   
Merrill Lynch reiterated its buy on GPT but cut its price target to $5.25.   
GPT shares firmed 1&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; to $4.48.   
NONI B BUY   
Austock has placed a buy on Noni B (NBL) in the wake of the retailers better-than-expected annual profit.   
The profit of $8.3 million was accompanied by a good cash position, good cash flow and a bigger dividend. &quot;Following recent share price weakness and an improving store opening outlook, we upgrade Noni B to a buy with a 12-month share price target of $4.70,&quot; Austock said.   
The broker said the increased price target also reflected higher-than-expected store openings and higher margin forecasts. Noni B shares shed 19&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; to $4.20.   
COMPUTERSHARE BUY   
Intersuisse says share register group Computershare (CPU) is well placed for growth.   
Commenting after Computershares latest annual profit, which was up 62 per cent to $US219.4 million ($277 million), Intersuisse said the company &quot;could grow earnings at a high rate for the foreseeable future, although cyclical sharemarket activity could add volatility as markets tend to act in sync&quot;. &quot;Computershares scale including depth of technology confers an important competitive advantage,&quot; it said.   
Intersuisse said it continued to recommend Computershare as a long-term buy, &quot;particularly from current levels with price/earnings ratios well below Computershares norm&quot;. Its shares rose 43&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; to $9.82.

			<TEXT>AACO BUY   
ABN AMRO Morgans has maintained its positive rating on  Australian Agricultural Company (AAC) and upped its target price despite the company posting a disappointing profit for the first half of 2007.   
The profit of $5.9 million, which was affected by a big tax credit in the previous corresponding period, was about half of what analysts had been expecting.   
ABN AMRO said it was difficult to consider investing in the company on an earnings analysis alone but urged investors to look at the underlying value of the rural properties.   
&quot;We rate AAC as a buy as we believe the value of AACs properties will continue to increase as they are situated in high-rainfall areas, the carrying capacity of the properties will continue to improve and it grows other high value crops,&quot; ABN AMRO said.   
It has increased its price target to $3.30, up from $2.50. AAC shares yesterday dropped 10&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; to $2.89.   
AXA ASIA PACIFIC BUY   
Intersuisse has advised investors to take advantage of the market correction to buy stock in AXA Asia Pacific (AXA) which just posted a very strong annual profit result.   
AXA posted a 23.1 per cent increase in profit to $374 million which Intersuisse said was ahead of targets and expectations.   
&quot;This was another excellent set of numbers from one of our favourite companies - admittedly with the tailwind of a bull market,&quot; it said.   
Intersuisse said it was not expecting the strong results to be replicated in the December half because of the current weakness in equity markets. AXA shares yesterday closed 8&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; weaker at $7.36.   
HAVILAH RESOURCES BUY   
StockAnalysis has confirmed its buy rating on junior explorer Havilah Resources (HAV) after the company recently announced it had the backing of international metals trading house Glencore to help develop the Kalkaroo project in South Australia.   
Havilah has also reported some strong drilling results from its Portia project also in South Australia at an area where the company hopes to start trial mining by early next year.   
&quot;The proposed trial pit appears to hold potential to extract about 200,000 tonnes of material and could yield over 40,000 ounces of gold,&quot; StockAnalysis said.   
Havilah shares gained 4&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; to $2.37.   
ILUKA RESOURCES SELL   
Goldman Sachs JBWere has maintained its sell rating on mineral sands miner Iluka Resources (ILU) after the company sold its Narama coal assets in the Hunter Valley to Xstrata for $53 million.   
The sale generated a profit of around $30 million, which  Goldman Sachs said was in line with its expectations. But the loss of the Narama earnings resulted in  Goldman Sachs reducing its forecast earnings.   
&quot;Unless you are a believer in corporate activity near term, there is no need to be here,&quot; it said.   
The company continues to be hindered by the strengthening Australian dollar, which also underpinned  Goldman Sachs rating. It has a 12-month target of $5.50 on the stock, which climbed 9&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; higher to $6.13.

			<TEXT>Cattle giant  Australian Agricultural Company said yesterday it was confident on the long term outlook for beef exports but its optimism failed to deter a 7 per cent slide in its share price after a disappointing half year net profit.   
Austock analyst Chris Wiltshire said the $5.9 million net profit for the six months to June 30 was around half consensus forecasts, although the shortfall was closer to $3 million after removing the temporary adverse impact of a mandatory balance date revaluation of its 630,000-head herd.   
Mr Wiltshire also noted that the unseasonally wet June in northern Australia had delayed cattle sales, deferring some income into the second half.   
The 30 per cent fall in net profit was also affected by a large tax credit in the previous corresponding half. Earnings before interest and tax rose a much healthier 75 per cent to $21.3 million, but they also were distorted by a $10 million settlement it won in February over the disputed sale of AMPs cattle empire Stanbroke to a rival bidder.   
AACo managing director Don Mackay said its properties in Queensland and the Northern Territory had mostly escaped the drought but it had been indirectly affected by the fall in cattle prices as drought-hit southern cattle producers were forced to offload stock.   
The high Australian dollar had also contributed to what he said was a disappointing cattle market in the first half, which had also contributed to the company holding cattle back from sale.   
AACo closed down 23&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; at $2.99.

			<TEXT>Australian Agricultural Company yesterday made an intriguing new pitch to investors to view it as a rare opportunity to take a stake in agricultural land in northern Australia.   
AACo chairman Nick Burton Taylor said it also saw opportunities for the 183-year-old cattle giant to be a big part of the emerging carbon market, given it owned and managed 1.2 per cent of Australias land mass, much of it in the high rainfall north.   
&quot;The opportunity is most likely to arise from the company establishing itself as a developer of carbon sinks,&quot; Mr Burton Taylor told AACos annual meeting in Brisbane.   
&quot;It is one of managements key tasks to construct a mechanism to enter this emerging and exciting market sector.&quot;   
Mr Burton Taylor noted AACos portfolio of 24 stations had risen $41.1 million in value last year and welcomed as a &quot;major milestone&quot; that its share price now was trading at a premium to net tangible asset value.   
That indicated acceptance its land holdings were now a key ingredient in valuing the company, a significant shift which recognised that land globally had become the scarcest of all resources.   
AACo managing director Don Mackay pointed to the debate in Australia on land and water use and said it was keen to participate in the development of high value agriculture.   
Mr Burton Taylor said AACo continued to have a positive view on the beef industry. Cattle markets had been tested by the high Australian dollar and difficulties in Japan and Korea but overall remained strong.   
However, he also warned Australia needed to develop a comprehensive strategy to deal with the &quot;chilling&quot; threat posed by the emergence of the South American Five - Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Chile - as high quality, low cost beef exporters.   
The group had a combined cattle herd of 280 million, compared to Australias 28 million, but now exported only 6.4 million tonnes of beef compared with Australias 3.6 million tonnes.   
He warned Australia needed a strategy to deal with the threat of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Chile.

			<TEXT>Two of Australias biggest corporate beef barons have taken the step of publicly warning governments against requiring the use of ethanol in fuel, arguing it could seriously harm Australias biggest rural industry.   
Australian Agricultural Company and the Northern Australian Pastoral Company yesterday issued separate statements saying that introducing a minimum ethanol content in fuel could artificially push up the price of grain, the main feedstock for ethanol, disadvantaging other grain users especially cattle producers trying to feed livestock.   
AACo, which has a herd of more than 500,000 cattle, said beef feedlots would be at a particular disadvantage and that would flow on to rest of the beef industry because lower margins would be passed on to the producers from whom they bought cattle.   
&quot;One rural industry should not be subsidised at the expense of another,&quot; AACos managing director Don Mackay said.   
&quot;Cattle production is by far the biggest user of agricultural land, the biggest rural employer, and the largest rural export industry. We need to remain globally competitive and therefore the beef industry has the most to lose if the wrong government policies are pursued.&quot;   
The move by the two big cattle producers, both based in Queensland, comes as the Government of Premier Peter Beattie considers implementing an election commitment to mandate a 5 per cent minimum ethanol content in fuel by 2010.   
NSW Premier Morris Iemma also made a commitment during his recent successful election campaign to introduce a 2 per cent minimum ethanol content in wholesale fuel this year as a first step to a stated aim of 10 per cent by 2011.   
Australia now has significantly lower use of biofuels than the US and Europe, where the renewable fuel industry is booming because of government mandates requiring their use.   
NAPCO chief executive Nigel Alexander said an effective subsidy for ethanol would be a great danger to the profitability of the beef industry and risk inflating the price of food to consumers.   
He also questioned its environmental benefits, noting support for grain-based ethanol could discourage investment in more environmentally sustainable alternatives such as ethanol from cellulose. It also increased the risk of marginal farming land being brought into production because of distorted grain prices.

			<TEXT>Futuris managing director Les Wozniczka has discounted speculation the drought-hit agribusiness group could be the subject of a takeover and carve-up by the aggressive and acquisition-hungry private equity sector.  
Mr Wozniczka said it had taken two centuries to build up the businesses which now made up Futuris, including farm services retail giant Elders, the country&apos;s biggest cattle owner, Australian Agricultural Company, in which it has 40 per cent, and half-owned Elders Rural Bank.  
It had also taken a number of years to reposition the former diversified conglomerate to focus on agribusiness, including the progressive sell-off of divisions such as automotive and property and acquisitions of significant interests in plantation forestry, fertiliser distribution and regional telecommunications.  
Mr Wozniczka said it would be &quot;pretty opportunistic&quot; for a bid to be made for the company after two years of poor seasons, notwithstanding it had performed better than many other agribusiness companies.  
&quot;I don&apos;t think it will happen,&quot; he said.  
&quot;I think our shareholder base is solid and supportive of what we are doing and I don&apos;t think they are going to be hellbent on selling out at this point in the cycle. If you are going to sell a farm you don&apos;t do it after two years of drought.&quot;  
Mr Wozniczka&apos;s comments confirm that any prospective bidder is likely to face a tough battle with Futuris, which has proved itself to be an aggressive and at times litigious opponent in its own regular attempts over the years to build strategic stakes and mount takeovers.  
There has been speculation Peter Yates&apos; Allco Equity Partners has been eyeing Futuris for a break-up, fuelled by Mr Yates&apos; comments earlier this month he was sizing up another significant publicly listed company other than Qantas.  
It is understood AEP already has a stake in the company, which has had a stubbornly ~underperforming share price for many years, in part driven by analyst and investor criticism of its complex asset plays and confusing earnings.  
Futuris shares fell 2&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; yesterday to $2.12, up from $1.69 last October but below their level in mid-1999. At the latest close, the group is valued at $1.55 billion.  
Mr Wozniczka also yesterday paid tribute to his predecessor and Futuris founder, Alan Newman, who resigned as a non-executive director of the company this week due to ill-health.  
Mr Newman&apos;s resignation ends 18 years at the company, including 14 years as chief executive during which he built it from a small brake pad manufacturer into a $1 billion company.  
&quot;Two hours with Alan Newman is worth two months with Macquarie Bank,&quot; Mr Wozniczka said.  
&quot;He&apos;s just a very good strategist.&quot;

			<TEXT>Futuris shares slipped lower yesterday, as chairman Stephen Gerlach warned full-year profits would be at the lower end of market expectations and the group could struggle to divest non-core assets.
Mr Gerlach told investors at the group&#8217;s annual meeting in Adelaide that while the company had &#8220;a continuing amount of interest&#8221; in its stakes in non-core assets such as cattle producer Australian Agricultural Company, &#8220;it&#8217;s almost impossible to do a deal quickly&#8221; in current market conditions.
He was &#8220;disappointed&#8221; the group had failed to divest its 43 per cent AACo stake during the 2007-08 year as expected.
Fears of the stock overhang created by Futuris&#8217; stake in AACo also drove the cattle producer&#8217;s share price south, with the stock closing more than 5 per cent, or 11&#162;, lower at $1.99. Futuris shares fell 3&#162; to $1.10.
Mr Gerlach also said Futuris&#8217; full-year profits would be hit in 2008-09 on costs associated with the restructure of its Elders business and the fallout of the financial crisis, the impact of which was too difficult to determine at this stage of the year.
The lower end of market consensus is for underlying full-year profit of $79.6 million, down from previous estimates of between $80 million and $90 million.

			<TEXT>AACo HOLD
Austock Securities believes Australian Agricultural Company (AAC) is largely an asset play rather than an earnings play as it is trading at more than 100 times full-year 2009 earnings whereas its current net tangible asset backing is $2.79 a share.
Both NPAT (net profit after tax) and EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) fell in the first half because of the strong Australian dollar, dry conditions and higher grain and freight costs.
Austock said the negative results were compounded by internal board and management instability.
It views the appointment of current acting chief executive Stephen Toms to the chief executive position as being positive for the stock.
Allowing for improving beef prices and the weakening of the Australian dollar, Austock&#8217;s forecast net tangible asset backing for AAC is $3.05 a share.
It has maintained its hold recommendation on the stock.
AAC slipped 4&#162; to $3.04.
ENVESTRA SELL
Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s revision of Envestra&#8217;s (ENV) outlook from stable to negative has prompted Patersons Securities to maintain its sell rating on the stock. The downgrade was largely due to the deterioration in Envestra&#8217;s outlook in Victoria and the group&#8217;s inability to improve its credit standing.
Patersons said the announcement was not surprising given Envestra&#8217;s &#8220;thin interest cover, high leverage, negative free cash flow and reliance on debt to fund expansion&#8221;.
Also, takeover rumours which have previously driven the stock have faded.
Envestra closed steady at 74&#162;.
STW COMMUNICATIONS BUY
Wilson HTM says the highlight of STW Communications Group&#8217;s (SGN) first-half results was the diversified media group&#8217;s 32 per cent growth in operating earnings.
This was offset by slower growth from agencies due to the loss of the Commonwealth Bank contract.
Wilson said STW Communication&#8217;s interim result was largely in line with its forecasts, although it expected the media and advertising group to face a more challenging trading environment.
It has maintained its buy recommendation for the stock with a target price of $1.60.
STW rose 2&#162; to $1.19.
DAVID JONES HOLD
Austock Securities has changed its recommendation for David Jones (DJS) from a buy to a hold, largely because the stock has rallied 50 per cent since mid-July.
Last week, David Jones upgraded its second-half profit growth guidance by 20 to 25 per cent despite slowing sales growth in the fourth quarter.
&#8220;David Jones retains solid earnings growth prospects beyond full-year 2008 with selling area growth from new stores and high-value refurbishments, a favourable industry position and further cost initiatives,&#8221; Austock said.
&#8220;We believe this is now in the price.&#8221;
The broker has a 12-month price target of $4.30 for the stock based on 15 times full-year 2009 earnings.
David Jones rose 13&#162; to $4.10.

			<TEXT>Futuris has hinted at a sale of its stakes in non-core assets such as cattle producer Australian Agricultural Company and internet company Amcom in the year ahead, after a 65 per cent drop in full-year profit to $36.4 million.
Outgoing chief executive Les Wozniczka also raised eyebrows during yesterday&#8217;s results announcement by suggesting the embattled agribusiness group&#8217;s next investment could be in aquaculture, despite Futuris selling out of its stake in Clean Seas Tuna this year.
Underlying net profit fell within the group&#8217;s guidance at $84.2 million &#8212; down from $105.4 million last year &#8212; but reported net profit took a $47.8 million hit on a series of write-downs and one-off costs associated with the restructure of Elders Rural Services.
Futuris chairman Stephen Gerlach said the result was disappointing, but the group still expected underlying net profit for 2008-09 to be between $85 million and $90 million.
Futuris shares rose 5&#162; to $1.30.
But analysts were less impressed, with some querying the board&#8217;s decision to allow Mr Wozniczka to preside over yesterday&#8217;s results and make comments on the direction of the group in the year ahead, given his impending departure.
Others suggested the group would struggle to meet its 2009 forecasts without divesting some or all of its non-core shareholdings.
Mr Wozniczka said the group hoped to divest its automotive operations this year.
Futuris maintained a fully franked final dividend of 5.5&#162;, to be paid on October 28.

			<TEXT>Australia&#8217;s biggest cattle producer yesterday trumpeted its return to positive cash flow, with a bullish management team promising its position would &#8220;only get stronger&#8221; as cattle prices rose.
A decision to sell 20,000 head of cattle helped Australian Agricultural Company report a positive operating cash flow of $5.9 million for the six months to June 30, up from negative $20 million in the previous corresponding period and the first time in more than two years its cash flow has been in the black.
Although the group handed down a $2.1 million loss for the half compared to a net profit of $5.9 million previously, last year&#8217;s result was influenced by the $8.8 million settlement by AMP of litigation over the 2003 sale of Stanbroke Pastoral Company.
Taking the settlement into account, operating earnings before interest and tax for the half rose 28 per cent to $16 million.
While drought, higher feed costs and subdued cattle prices weighed on the latest results, AACo said cattle prices were expected to rise on the back of a falling Australian dollar and improved seasonal conditions over the next six months.
Analysts yesterday agreed with the company&#8217;s projections of a strengthened cash-flow position in the second half, backing new chief executive Stephen Toms&#8217; suggestions that AACo was on track to beat its cash-flow forecast of $15 million for the full year.
&#8220;This result, being a small loss, is not comparative to what the full year will look like,&#8221; ABN AMRO&#8217;s Belinda Moore said. &#8220;AACo has an excellent business model (and) with cattle prices strengthening they could have a very good second half and we can expect net profit to substantially improve.&#8221;
Market watchers welcomed the permanent appointment of Mr Toms, who had been acting in the top job since May, saying it would end uncertainty that had been weighing on the share price.
Analysts said they also expected Mr Toms to be more vigilant with cash flow than his predecessors.
Investors left the stock unchanged at $3.01.
Mr Toms said his focus would be to drive cash flow while controlling debt until global credit markets settled. The group would need a cash injection of at least $100 million to further develop land and boost herd numbers to targeted levels, and flagged the creation of an agricultural fund to raise capital.
AACo, which operates 24 cattle stations and two feedlots, declared a 7&#162; unfranked dividend to be paid on October 16.

			<TEXT>Tensions between Australian Agricultural Company and its majority shareholder, Futuris Corp, have bubbled over, with Futuris set to make a grab for total control by voting its 43 per cent stake against the re-election of AACo chairman Nick Burton Taylor at the company&#8217;s annual meeting in Brisbane today.
Mr Burton Taylor told WestBusiness that the board spill, which could result in the dumping of three independent AACo directors, would be highly damaging.
He said Futuris was taking &#8220;a wrecking ball&#8221; to the AACo board for &#8220;their own corporate purposes&#8221;.
Futuris blames the AACo board for making the sale of its 43 per cent stake in AACo &#8220;difficult&#8221; and has accused Mr Burton Taylor of being &#8220;too passionate&#8221; about the company.
But the AACo chairman said his group had supported the unsuccessful sell-down and believes he has been made a scapegoat to allow Futuris to smooth the way for another sell-down attempt or potentially break up the company, like the break-up of Stanbroke Pastoral Co assets in 2004.
&#8220;Our ambition was to see them sell down,&#8221; Mr Burton Taylor said.
Futuris had been trying to offload its $325 million cornerstone investment in the beef producer since October. But earlier this month it conceded it had failed to find a buyer, saying none of the offers received had certainty of execution or timing.
During the auction AACo demanded that interested parties demonstrate the capacity to buy the stake and sign a confidentiality agreement.
&#8220;We were religious about imposing that obligation, but it has been represented to me by Futuris that this was unnecessarily obstructionist,&#8221; Mr Burton Taylor said.
Futuris is also understood to have taken umbrage at an AACo board proposal to install a &#8220;different ownership model&#8221; with the aim of protecting the interests of minority shareholders.
The diversified industrial group is seeking to install its own nominated director, Charles Bright, as chairman at today&#8217;s meeting.
&#8220;After close consideration of the matter, Futuris has concluded that the chairman&#8217;s re-election is contrary to its interests and the best interests of other AACo shareholders,&#8221; it said.
Last week, Futuris held confidential talks with independent directors Chris Roberts and Greg Paramor to determine if they would support the motion. But both men yesterday came out in support of the incumbent AACo chairman and have threatened to resign if Futuris is successful in removing Mr Burton Taylor.
The falling out has raised further questions about Futuris&#8217;s management style and business strategy.
Futuris chief executive Les Wozniczka is known as a demanding manager and market watchers believe the brawl is further evidence his brash style is eroding shareholder value.
&#8220;The management are difficult to deal with,&#8221; said one analyst, who requested anonymity.
&#8220;They are effectively a listed vulture fund and have a policy of investing in difficult investment areas ... and in the last five to seven years they have been less than successful.&#8221;
AACo was spun out of Futuris&#8217; Elders arm by former boss Alan Newman in August 2001. Since then Futuris&#8217; share price has declined 25 per cent while AACo has nearly tripled.
Futuris dipped 3&#162; to $1.87 while AACo shed 6&#162; to $2.90.

			<TEXT>Investors punished rural conglomerate Futuris Corporation and beef producer Australian Agricultural Company (AACo) yesterday, stripping $261 million from their collective market valuations in the wake of Futuris&#8217; decision to abort a planned sale of its 43 per cent stake in AACo.
By close of trade, Futuris&#8217; market valuation had fallen 11 per cent to $1.4 billion with shares closing down 24&#162; at $1.87. AACo&#8217;s valuation slumped 9 per cent to $729.4 million after its shares fell 29&#162; to $2.84.
&#8220;The share price reaction is disappointing, but understandable,&#8221; Futuris chief executive Les Wozniczka said yesterday.
&#8220;The asset is still there, it has still got value, so I would expect that once the market adjusts to that we will see some improvement.&#8221;
Analysts said both companies were sold down because the decision took AACo out of play as a possible takeover target and Futuris failed to deliver on a promised sale which would have been used to pay down debt.
Stockbrokers Austock Securities and Goldman Sachs JBWere both downgraded Futuris on the back on the news.
Austock Securities analyst Paul Jensz downgraded the agribusiness stock from a buy to a hold and flagged further asset sales to lower debt.
&#8220;In isolation the withdrawal of AACo buyers can be attributed to tough debt markets,&#8221; Mr Jensz said.
&#8220;However, we view that the lack of acceptable return on investment over 10 years cannot be blamed solely on environment issues.
&#8220;Futuris has yet to prove itself a proactive manager that can deliver above-average return on investment in the medium term.&#8221;
Futuris forecast full-year underlying profit to be around $100 million, depending on continued good rainfall and sales of managed investment schemes.
Goldman Sachs JBWere analyst Andrew Gibson said Futuris&#8217; profit guidance was below market expectations and downgraded his recommendation from buy to hold.
&#8220;The termination of this sale process means we now expect a higher debt position going forward and hence a higher interest charge,&#8221; Mr Gibson said in a client note.
Mr Wozniczka said the enterprise value of AACo was more than $1 billion.
&#8220;The nature of the asset is land-rich, cash poor, and in the circumstances of current market conditions that transaction was always going to be a challenge and, frankly, not something that we had envisaged would be the case in October when we announced it,&#8221; he said.
Mr Wozniczka said Futuris remained committed to AACo.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a good company,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s always room for improvement of course, but we will carry on with our investment there.&#8221;

			<TEXT>Diversified agribusiness Futuris Corporation has scrapped plans to offload its 43 per cent stake in Australian Agricultural Company (AACo), offsetting yesterday&#8217;s news with an upbeat profit outlook.
Despite the current boom in agricultural markets, Futuris said none of the offers received for its stake in AACo had &#8220;certainty of execution&#8221;, and as a result the company had decided to pull out of the sale process.
&#8220;Market recognition of the strategic and capital value of basic food production operations and agricultural land has increased significantly since the divestment proposal was announced,&#8221; the company said.
AACo, Australia&#8217;s biggest cattle station holder, said the decision gave &#8220;finality to what has been a difficult phase over the past six months&#8221;. &#8220;AACo can now move forward with confidence on a range of initiatives designed to take advantage of renewed international interest in the value and importance of agricultural production,&#8221; it said.
Shares in AACo have jumped 25 per cent since Futuris hired Citigroup and Caliburn Partnership in October to sell its holding but slipped 6&#162; to $3.13 yesterday on the news, valuing Futuris&#8217;s stake at $345 million.
Analysts also expressed disappointment Futuris was unable to sell down its holding in AACo.
&#8220;We would have preferred Futuris had exited AACo. It does increase the volatility in Futuris&#8217;s earnings, and certainly the return on the capital invested hasn&#8217;t been that significant recently,&#8221; Shaw Stockbroking analyst Brent Mitchell said.
&#8220;But they see a significant improvement for AACo, which may have not been reflected in the offers they received.&#8221;
Another analyst, who requested anonymity, said the failure of the AACo sale would increase the financial pressure on Futuris and may force the company to sell other assets.
&#8220;I think they are over-geared and I think they are a forced seller of assets,&#8221; the analyst said.
But Futuris painted a rosier picture for the future, tipping full-year underlying earnings would be at the higher end of forecasts of $154 million to $183 million, while underlying profit attributable to shareholders is expected to be about $100 million. The forecasts are based on continuing good rainfall and managed investment scheme (MIS) sales.
Futuris chief executive Les Wozniczka said the earnings outlook was positive and augured well for the company in more typical seasonal conditions.

			<TEXT>Agricultural companies ABB Grain and Australian Agricultural Company were both given a price query from the Australian Securities Exchange yesterday after their stocks made stellar gains in the past week.
Over the week shares in ABB Grain have appreciated from $8.98 to an intraday high of $10.34 yesterday. The South Australian grains marketer said it was not aware of any internal company reason for the rally.
But the company took the opportunity to highlight the improving outlook for its grain marketing business, including rain prospects, bullish recommendations from analysts and expectations of fresh opportunities in the deregulated wheat marketing sector. ABB dipped 1&#162; to $10 .
AACo also declared to the market that there was nothing to disclose over its share run, which climbed from $2.88 to a high of $3.28 in less than three trading days. AACo, which finished up 9&#162; at $3.19 , said there had not been any material developments in the planned sale of Futuris&#8217; 43 per cent stake in the company.
The wider Australian sharemarket closed little changed with weak oil and gold prices weighing on resources companies. Investors were also sitting on the sidelines awaiting the outcome of the US Federal Reserve&#8217;s two-day interest rate meeting which started on Monday night.
The S&amp;P-ASX 200 index added 4.2 points to 5606.9 as the all-ordinaries index firmed 2.3 points to 5672.6. On the Sydney Futures exchange, the June share price index futures contract shed 25 points to 5625 on a volume of 17,976 contracts.
Fund managers said sentiment in the financial sector had improved in recent weeks, but investors should expect more weak earnings from banks over the coming months.
&#8220;People were very concerned about a month ago that we were going to have a breakdown in the financial system. What we&#8217;re seeing now is a decline in the perception of risk from the extreme level a month ago,&#8221; portfolio manager at White Funds Management Angus Gluskie said.
&#8220;But we&#8217;re not out of the woods yet. There&#8217;s no doubt that we&#8217;re going to go through a period of weak bank earnings over the next six to nine months.&#8221;
Among the major banks, Westpac lifted 37&#162; to $25.55 , NAB firmed 5&#162; to $30.30 , Commonwealth Bank gained 10&#162; to $44.80 , but ANZ slipped 14&#162; to $22.06 . Financial services player BT Investment Management shed 10&#162; to $3.30 after it reaffirmed its guidance of an annual profit below its prospectus forecast. St George Bank fell 25&#162; to $26.86 .
In the resources sector, BHP Billiton was 29&#162; higher at $43.89 and Rio Tinto fell $2.30 to $141.20 as it reached an agreement on tax clauses for the company&#8217;s proposed $US2 billion ($2.13 billion) nickel project in Sulawesi, Indonesia.
Apollo Minerals soared 6.5&#162; to 33&#162; after Chinese Iron and Steel Group revealed it would lift its stake in the prospector to 19.9 per cent from 12 per cent.
Among WA stocks, Wesfarmers ceded 23&#162; to $36.52 , Woodside dropped $1.22 to $56.88 , Fortescue Metals Group gained 15&#162; to $7.62 , Euroz Securities slipped 5&#162; to $3.35 and WA Newspapers slumped 56&#162; to $9.94 .
&#8226;The Australian dollar closed lower after a quiet session where its biggest move came when European markets opened late afternoon.
At the Perth close the dollar was at US93.41&#162; from US93.75&#162;.

			<TEXT>BRIEFING   
AACo plunges   
The worlds biggest cattle company,  Australian Agricultural Company (AACo), has posted a 64 per cent drop in annual profit due to volatile cattle prices, a strong Australian dollar and higher feed costs. AACo said its net profit fell to $3.6 million from $10.1 million for 2006, despite a rise in earnings before interest and tax to $31 million from $22 million in 2006. The station owner said the result was also affected by the inclusion in the 2006 result of a $6 million tax benefit related to the sale of AACos Wrotham Park station in North Queensland. But it said there had been a good start to the 2008 season, particularly in large parts of southern Australia, and cattle prices were rising as farmers sought to restock herds.   
Primary draws the line   
The fate of Symbion should be sealed within days, after suitor Primary Health Care ramped up the pressure by announcing it will not increase its $2.7 billion cash offer. Primary also said its bid would become unconditional if it could secure at least 50.1 per cent acceptance for its offer &quot;by the end&quot; of next Tuesday. If it cannot declare its offer unconditional, Primary, whose offer is scheduled to close on February 21, will, in the absence of a competing offer, walk away from the assets it has coveted for years and actively chased for the past 12 months.   
Smith joins  Rio Tinto
Chamber of Minerals and Energy president David Smith has resigned to take up a new position with  Rio Tinto in Africa. Dr Smith will take on the role of managing director and president of Rio Tintos iron ore operations in Africa, Simandou, heading up Rios planned development of a major new iron ore project in Guinea.   
Raid on broker   
Stockbroker Findlays yesterday confirmed its Sydney offices were raided last month by Australian Federal Police looking for information relating to Fairstar Resources $200 million takeover bid for Golden West Resources. The company, which is advising Fairstar on the offer, said it had provided documents relating to the offer but denied reports that computers were seized in the raid. Fairstar recently extended its takeover offer of seven shares for one Golden West share until February 13.   
CMA bulks up in NZ   
CMA Corporation has expanded its operations in New Zealand by acquiring transport service businesses and a secondary ferrous processing operation for $3.5 million. Newly appointed CMA managing director Doug Rowe said the acquisitions provided higher levels of service and greater support for the companys growing New Zealand operations.   
Chinese buy dairy stake   
Australian dairy company Montec International said a Chinese investment groups purchase of a 19.9 per cent stake in its business would help it to expand into Beijing and Shanghai. Montec has reached an agreement with Puji Wealth Management for the private placement of nearly eight million shares at 3&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; each.   
Disney tops forecast   
The Walt Disney Company has beaten Wall Street expectations to record a 9 per cent jump in quarterly revenue, despite its profit falling 26 per cent. Disneys net income of $US1.25 billion ($1.38 billion) was down on $US1.7 billion last year.

			<TEXT>The countrys biggest landholder  Australian Agricultural Company (AACo) has ousted its long-serving chief executive and managing director Don Mackay as it pursues new opportunities developing rural financial products for institutional and international investors.   
The board of AACo, which owns 24 stations spanning 7.9 million hectares of land and running up to 600,000 beef cattle, said in a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange that &quot;the change to AACo management was initiated by the board in response to anticipated commercial opportunities and circumstances facing the company&quot;.   
Both AACo and major shareholder  Futuris Corp were quick to play down any link between the boards decision to remove Mr Mackay, who was first appointed as managing director in 1999, and the current auction of Futuris 43 per cent stake in the 183-year-old company.   
AACo chairman and interim chief executive Nick Burton Taylor said there was no rancour or criticism of Mr Mackay.   
&quot;Even though the timing to some may look odd, we believe that we have just got on with the task of running the company and that is why we continued on with this decision, not withstanding that Futuris sale,&quot; he said. &quot;There is no linkage between the Futuris sale and the actions we have taken.&quot;   
Futuris is understood to be considering a number of bids for its stake in the AACo, which has a market capitalisation of $805 million. Among the rumoured bidders are Brazils JBS group, which last year bought meat processor Australian Meat Holdings, and global investment house  Macquarie Bank.
Any buyer who bids for the total Futuris stake must make a takeover offer for the whole of AACo, but some analysts consider the current equity market volatility will see the Futuris stake broken up.   
Futuris managing director Les Wozniczka said he still expected the sale of AACo to be completed by the end of June.   
AACo shares lost over 10 per cent yesterday, falling 36&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; to $3.14.

			<TEXT>FUTURIS   
BUY   
Austock Securities has given Futuris (FCL) a buy rating for the first time since it started covering the company, factoring in the planned sale of Futuris 43 per cent stake in  Australian Agricultural Company into a new price target of $2.39, up from $2.18.   
The broker said the company should put the funds from the sale of its interest in AACo, about $250 million, into the agricultural sector.   
&quot;Futuris has critical mass in the Australian agribusiness sector via Elders and investments across finance, trading, forestry, beef, wool and merchandise,&quot; Austock said.   
&quot;Australia, and the rest of the world, is scrambling to catch up on 50 years of neglect with supply side capacity.   
&quot;On top of this the Australian grain, dairy and forestry sectors are gaining extra sustainable growth options with industry structural reforms.&quot;   
The broker raised medium-term net profit by 20 per cent, driven by lower interest expenses and better expected earnings from Elders.   
Futuris put on 1&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; to $2.20.   
EQUINOX MINERALS   
OUTPERFORM   
Credit Suisse says Equinox Minerals (EQN) is well placed to weather proposed increases to tax and royalties in Zambia, where the company operates, and has given it an outperform rating.   
The broker said a new tax regime in Zambia, recently flagged by President Levy Mwanawasa, was a &quot;virtual certainty&quot; but was unlikely to be draconian and Equinoxs value would remain &quot;significantly higher than its current share price&quot; even under higher taxes and royalties.   
Credit Suisse set a price target of $8.75. Equinox Minerals shed 18&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; to $6.03.   
ADITYA BIRLA MINERALS   
BUY   
Goldman Sachs JBWere says  Aditya Birla Minerals (ABY) has been undervalued compared to its peers and it expects it to be re-rated as the copper price appreciates over the year.   
The broker set a buy rating with a price target of $4.64 after the company unveiled strong December quarterly production results.   
Goldman Sachs also upgraded its 2007-08 earnings forecasts by about 3 per cent, saying it expected further improvements to production at Adityas Nifty sulfide operation.   
&quot;Aditya is a high-cost producer and as such is very leveraged to copper prices which we believe will continue to increase over the course of this year,&quot; the broker said.   
Aditya Birla firmed 6&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; to $2.56.   
PALADIN ENERGY   
BUY   
Bell Potter Securities has given Paladin Energy (PDN) a buy rating, saying the companys recently announced solid production results were underpinned by a strong outlook for uranium prices.   
&quot;We believe operational issues have clouded the outlook for Paladin given that uranium fundamentals remain robust, in our view, due to limited primary supply growth, depleting secondary sources and growing demand largely underpinned by a focus on global warming issues,&quot; Bell Potter said.   
The broker set a price target of $9.05. Paladin climbed 43&amp;lt;cents&amp;gt; to $6.38.
