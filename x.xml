			<TEXT>QANTAS and Ansett are well into expensive rectification programs - Qantas is expected to spend about $118 million to eradicate the millennium bug from its computer software in one of the most crucial consumer protection measures.
The airline industry is highly reliant on date-based computer systems for everything from flight reservations to maintenance systems.
Executive general manager for corporate services, David Burden, said Qantas had also been working with manufacturers to ensure that electronics within the aircraft were bug-free before 2000.
&quot;We&apos;re very, very confident that everything that&apos;s necessary to keep an airplane in the air will be working very effectively,&quot; Mr Burden said.
Byram Johnston, Asia-Pacific head of technology company PA Consulting Group, said &quot;the worst-case scenario with air conditioners, for example, is that they will shut down and then they will have to be fixed&quot;. &quot;TVs, VCRs - in fact most commercial electronic goods are not much of an issue, most instances will be a nuisance and it will be a case of products not working until they are fixed,&quot; Mr Johnston said.
&quot;In the case of microwave ovens, for example, there are some that won&apos;t work and will be thrown away. For smaller items, such as cameras which display a date, in the two-year-digit format, it&apos;s no big deal.
&quot;We should be more concerned about electricity supply and power stations.&quot;
Power companies claim they have the problem in hand.
Integral Energy chief executive Alex Walker said his company had taken the issue seriously, calling in a third-party organisation to review its year 2000 requirements.
&quot;The review found no serious problems with our (technology) or our supply of electricity nothing that could not be overcome,&quot; Mr Walker said.
There may also be good news for car owners worried that the bug could stop on-board computer systems.
Ford Australia customer assistance centre manager Phil Ramsden said his understanding was that there were no on-board systems that would be operationally affected.
As for traffic lights, the NSW Roads and Traffic Authority said it was testing its systems but was confident the bug would not pose a risk to driver safety.
An area of greater concern is medical equipment.
Mr Johnston cited a survey suggesting 40 per cent of all IV drips in Britain would need to be adjusted.
A spokesman for medical equipment supplier Toshiba Australia Medical Systems said the only problem encountered so far related to obstetric work and was trivial. Otherwise, all existing products complied.
The bug will affect any computer system that uses only two numerals to represent the &quot;year&quot; portion of a date field, such as in credit-card issue and expiry dates, originally a space-saving means for limited computer memory.
The problem will have the greatest impact from the stroke of midnight on New Year&apos;s Eve 1999. Many computers will see the 99 portion of the date field change to 00, and interpret that new date to be 1900.
In the case of a credit card, if the expiry date falls in 2000 or beyond, the computer may interpret it to have expired more than 90 years before the issue date, and will reject the transaction.
Credit agencies claim they have the problem rectified.

			<TEXT>QANTAS cabin crew have been pouring alcohol down sinks on planes, and pilots have dumped fuel in a furious protest about a cut to Christmas meal allowances.
Until this year, Qantas crew working on Christmas Day received a double allowance to cover price rises in yuletide buffets and meals.
But flight attendants and pilots were told only this month that their festive-season allowances would be slashed.
Senior flight attendants have confirmed that staff tipped out expensive wine and champagne during flights.
One said that although staff knew a bottle of wine was &quot;worth pennies to Qantas&quot;, it was &quot;the only physical action employees can take to make themselves feel better about being screwed&quot;. &quot;The crew are furious,&quot; said one senior flight attendant, who did not wish to be named.
&quot;I can guarantee that. They don&apos;t get any angrier than when it comes down to this pettiness, when allowances are cut.&quot;
A Qantas source said flight attendants who stayed in Melbourne on Christmas Day received a $36 meal allowance, even though the Hilton, where they stayed, charged $65 for its Christmas buffet.
Pilots - who receive the same allowance have been taking on extra fuel, only to dump it as a backlash against the airline.
&quot;Pilots do dump fuel, we don&apos;t deny that,&quot; an official with the Flight Attendants Association of Australia (FAAA) said.
&quot;They&apos;ll take on excess fuel, then dump a couple of tonnes as they&apos;re flying along.&quot; Crew have been told a Taxation Office ruling is behind the allowance cut, but inquiries to Qantas management and the Taxation Office have failed to find any evidence of such a ruling.
&quot;We have confirmed with the Tax Office that there&apos;s no problem,&quot; the FAAA official said.
A Qantas spokesman confirmed that cabin crew and pilots were not paid a double meal allowance on Christmas Day.
Instead, all crew received a &quot;range of Christmas gifts&quot;. Qantas also contributed to celebrations for crew away from home on Christmas Day.
&quot;It&apos;s a fairer deal for everyone,&quot; the spokesman said.
He said that while the airline admitted to Christmas cuts, it denied the company&apos;s pilots had dumped fuel in retaliation.
&quot;We have no evidence of that happening, nor of airline staff pouring alcohol down sinks,&quot; he said.
** Qantas cabin crew are also fighting a move that will see about 800 supervisors demoted.
The airline proposes to cut the number of cabin supervisors on each flight from three to one.

			<TEXT>A FORMER air hostess who developed an acute fear of flying after being caught in an electrical storm 24 years ago has been awarded $162,000 in compensation in a case still before the courts.
The former flight attendant, Susan Pepper, says she now can only cope with working eight hours a week as a volunteer radio announcer on a Brisbane classical music station.
But Qantas Airways is taking legal action against Comcare, the Commonwealth Government&apos;s workers&apos; compensation arm in Queensland, to stop the compensation payment, arguing Ms Pepper&apos;s &quot;alleged psychological upset&quot; was not caused by the flight.
This is despite determinations by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and Comcare that Ms Pepper continues to suffer a work-related injury and incapacity to work.
The airline, which merged with Australian Airlines (formerly TAA) in 1992 argues it was not consulted on an agreed settlement between Comcare and Ms Pepper and is seeking to have Comcare&apos;s refusal to review the agreement overturned.
In 1975, Ms Pepper said she developed an acute anxiety reaction as a result of working as an hostess on a TAA Fokker Friendship which was caught in a severe storm between Brisbane and Bundaberg two years earlier.
But Qantas argues Ms Pepper&apos;s capacity to work substantially more hours is evidenced by the fact she voluntarily resigned from the airline and worked for several employers, including the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation. A Qantas spokeswoman declined to comment yesterday.

			<TEXT>QANTAS has finally sold three of its five north Queensland island resorts for $25 million about $4 million short of the asking price.
After almost 18 months on the market, the airline contracted on Wednesday to sell Dunk, Bedarra and Brampton island resorts to P&amp;O Australia Ltd.
Qantas said it also hoped to sell its Great Keppel Resort in the next few months.
The five island resorts, including Lizard Island resort, have been owned by Qantas subsidiary Australian Resorts, since Qantas acquired the properties along with Australian Airlines in 1992.
Qantas first called for expressions of interest in May 1996, claiming it wanted to concentrate on its airline operations.
Some in the real estate sales industry at the time predicted a quick sale at a reasonable price was unlikely, given Daydream Island in the Whitsundays sold for only $22 million - one fifth of its establishment cost.
Qantas chief executive James Strong said the sale would ensure focus on the core airline business, but the airline would continue to hold its sub-lease interest on the 40-unit Lizard Island resort.
He said in the short term, Qantas would maintain De Havilland Twin Otter air services between the mainland and the islands.
&quot;In the longer term, it will be a decision for the new owners to determine how guests will be transferred to and from the resorts,&quot; Mr Strong said.
P&amp;O Australia Ltd managing director Richard Hein said that the purchase of the three resort properties effectively doubled the P&amp;O Resort Holidays portfolio.

			<TEXT>THREE Great Barrier Reef island resorts are set for facelifts after Qantas ended a search for a buyer, but abandoned hope of selling another tropical retreat.
P&amp;O Australia contracted on Wednesday to pay Qantas $25 million for resorts on Dunk and Brampton islands, as well as a cloistered celebrity haven on Bedarra Island.
P&amp;O Australia managing director Richard Hein said the buyer had finalised plans for &quot;immediate development&quot;. The deal followed more than 18 months of marketing by the airline, which said in May last year it wanted to sell five Queensland island resorts - the others being on Lizard and Great Keppel islands - so it could concentrate on its core business. It reportedly hoped to fetch up to $70 million for the clutch, operated by subsidiary Australian Resorts. But, announcing the sale, Qantas chief executive James Strong said it had removed the exclusive Lizard Island resort from the market. The decision to retain its sub-lease on Lizard - east of Cape York peninsula - follows Suncorp&apos;s sale of the ground lease in July.
Mr Strong said the company had a &quot;potential purchaser&quot; for Great Keppel resort, and hoped to make an announcement &quot;in the coming months&quot;. Mr Hein - whose company also owns Heron Island resort on the Great Barrier Reef said improvements to the resorts would &quot;meet the highest standards expected by both domestic and overseas tourists&quot;. The sale must by approved by the Queensland Government and the Foreign Investment Review Board.

			<TEXT>Aviation David Forman THE proposed alliance between Ansett Australia, Singapore Airlines and Air New Zealand would boost competition in Australian air travel and create new tourism jobs, the airlines said yesterday.
But without it competition for air services in Australia would diminish.
Ansett would not be able to match Qantas, whose merger with Australian Airlines and joint services agreement with British Airways had &quot;seriously eroded Ansett&apos;s ability to compete vigorously and effectively&quot;. The three would-be partners filed an application for approval for their proposal with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission yesterday.
The submission says Qantas is in a market position &quot;Ansett cannot match&quot;. &quot;Seen over the longer term, the imbalance between Qantas and Ansett must seriously threaten competition in Australian aviation.&quot;
The submission says the alliance would provide very substantial public benefits.
It would provide improved services to consumers through combining the complementary routes provided by the three airlines.
Tourism would be promoted by the more attractive routes from various parts of the world to Australia.

			<TEXT>THE Queensland Government has beaten its NSW and Victorian counterparts in attracting Qantas to establish a international phone bookings centre in Brisbane.
Qantas said the new centre, which would take bookings from all over the world, would create 270 jobs for the city.
The decision was made after Qantas was offered several start-up incentives under the Borbidge Government&apos;s investment incentive scheme.
The creation of the centre will coincide with the consolidation of the airline&apos;s Queensland office-based operations into the one building.

			<TEXT>QUEENSLAND has spent millions of dollars luring Qantas to open regional headquarters in Brisbane, fuelling the interstate bidding war for business investment.
Premier Rob Borbidge said yesterday the Qantas centre, which will field telephone inquiries and bookings from Britain, the US and Asia-Pacific, would create 270 jobs and inject $8.7 million a year into the State&apos;s economy.
Mr Borbidge said the Government had offered Qantas incentives to base the headquarters in Brisbane but said the value of the taxpayer-funded package was &quot;commercial-in-confidence&quot;. He said Qantas chief executive James Strong had driven a &quot;hard bargain&quot; during the negotiations, hatched over a business breakfast after a premiers&apos; conference in Canberra in April.
&quot;I think it&apos;s fair to say while James drives a hard bargain, it&apos;s worked out to be a very satisfactory arrangement,&quot; he said.

			<TEXT>HAVING heard of the &quot;legendary&quot; service, I decided to fly Qantas this year to London and return via Singapore.
When we took off from Sydney there were people going everywhere but nothing seemed to be happening.
Drinks were hard to get and after the meal the cabin staff disappeared. One passenger had his flight attendant button pressed for over half an hour waiting for attention. In short the service was abysmal.
This was the same on each of the four legs I flew.
Considering I could have flown KLM (as I had previously) for about $500 less (and the service was excellent on KLM) to say I was disappointed was a bit of an understatement. In future I will fly with almost any carrier except Qantas and I feel sorry I am even considering such a move.
As Miranda Devine said in her column (Daily Telegraph, December 16), it is an emotional attachment with Qantas, it is our national carrier and I am a very proud Aussie.

			<TEXT>BECAUSE of cost cutting and restructuring, we at Qantas engineering and maintenance are experiencing job insecurity and, to a certain degree, low morale. Jason Yeo&apos;s claim (Daily Telegraph, December 16) that low morale &quot;translates to diminished quality of work&quot; is derogatory, insulting, and could decrease morale even further.
Speak for yourself, Mr Yeo. We are working harder than ever to prevent outsourcing of aircraft maintenance, by delivering the same high-quality product as before, while striving to improve our efficiency.
We already know that engineering is a vital component of Qantas. Now we&apos;re trying to prove to our directors and shareholders that we are an economically viable component of the company.
I hope that the public are aware that as we continue to maintain our fleet, we will continue to deliver the high-quality product as expected, not only because it&apos;s a tradition but because being a Qantas engineer translates to having a moral obligation to personal and public safety.

			<TEXT>WELL said, Miranda Devine (Daily Telegraph, December 11) in your column about the service that Qantas provides on their flights.
Last January, on a flight to Vietnam, my mother and I were subjected to rude and unhelpful flight attendants. Getting a glass of water was a task and I back you up on noisy staff, stale bread and frozen butter!
I go overseas at least once every year and I&apos;d like to think my holidays will start and finish on a high note, but that would be just about impossible if you are flying with Qantas!
ALLISON PICTON Hazelbrook
READERS commenting on Miranda Devine&apos;s article about Qantas flights (Daily Telegraph, December 11), have missed the point. That is, that morale of staff at Qantas has plummeted to an all-time low.
Constantly being reminded of how quickly we can be replaced or outsourced has taken its toll. When flight attendants have low morale the end result is poor customer service. When engineers have low morale it translates to diminished quality of work.
I&apos;ll leave the implications of that to the reader.

			<TEXT>SINCE my column last week criticising Qantas customer service, I have received numerous calls and letters enough for another column, in fact.
Now, according to the Flight Attendants&apos; Association and other sources, members of senior Qantas management have been spreading the rumour I have sour grapes because I &quot;demanded an upgrade&quot; and didn&apos;t get one.
Sour grapes have nothing to do with the horrific experience I had on a Qantas flight from LA recently.
And clearly I&apos;m not alone in my dissatisfaction with our national airline.
Passengers, pilots, flight attendants, ex-security staff and pay-office personnel have rung to say Qantas is no longer the proud airline it once was.
Adrian Burke, managing director of Otto Bock Orthopaedic Industries in Chippendale is typical. After a run of bad experiences, his company doesn&apos;t use Qantas any more.
&quot;We&apos;re a medium-sized company but we spend $150,000 a year in travel,&quot; says Burke. &quot;I&apos;ve directed my staff that we don&apos;t use Qantas any more.&quot;
Frequent flyer Sheila Payne, of Tascott, wrote a letter of &quot;constructive criticism&quot; to Qantas after a &quot;display of exceedingly poor service and disinterest by the in-flight crew during a (September) flight from Honolulu to Sydney ... We (were) treated as if we were cattle being herded into a cramped truck.&quot;
Her letter has not been answered.
A pilot of 31 years rang to say that, since the coffee brought to him on the flight deck is weak and cold, &quot;I can&apos;t imagine what the passengers are getting&quot;. &quot;One of the problems we have with our cabin service is that the people who are employed (cannot) be sacked if they don&apos;t do their job properly.
&quot;The reason all the Asian airlines are doing so well is they&apos;re able to hire healthy young people to do the job whereas we have no retirement date for our cabin crew (many of whom) get old and lazy.&quot;
Another pilot says: &quot;One of the problems is Qantas is trying to fix things by sacking or recategorising people who aren&apos;t doing a good job and that&apos;s led to so much anxiety amongst everyone that you get this lowness in morale.&quot;
A former staffer says security at the airport is lax because Qantas has reduced the number of security staff and handed over much of its operation to Australian Protective Services, the outfit which allowed Greenpeace protesters on to the roof of the Prime Minister&apos;s Kirribilli residence in October.
He claims in the past six months unauthorised people have wandered on to the tarmac. And he says when he recently locked his car inside the jet base without his security pass he was able to leap the fence with impunity.
&quot;If I can do it in 10 seconds, so can a terrorist,&quot; he said.
Another passenger, Kevin, said: &quot;I did the Qantas flight back from LA to Sydney six weeks ago and I was served the same disastrous pasta meal you were.
&quot;I made a formal complaint on the plane about it as a member of the frequent flyer club ... Of course they haven&apos;t got back to me. They don&apos;t give a damn. The service has gone something shocking.&quot;
A high-profile Olympic official said of Qantas first-class: &quot;They&apos;re tired as hell. They throw the food at you and it&apos;s a lucky dip whether your in-house video works.&quot;
Passenger Melanie said: &quot;I&apos;m finally glad someone at least has written about the appalling service on Qantas because it was exactly like that in &apos;94 when I went overseas and it was like that again when I went back in &apos;95 and &apos;96 and I&apos;m never flying with that airline again.&quot;
Of about 30 phone calls received since Thursday, all but two were anti-Qantas.
One Qantas flight attendant rang to tell me I was a &quot;bitch&quot; who writes &quot;a lot of crap&quot;. An &quot;airline representative from another country&quot;, left a message saying: &quot;You really have no credibility whatsoever ... I really sincerely hope I don&apos;t have the pleasure of serving you on one of my flights, honey, because you&apos;ll get diddly squat.&quot; But other flight attendants took the opposite view.
&quot;I can&apos;t give you my name but I&apos;m Qantas crew and I want to thank you for your column. We&apos;re just being murdered out there,&quot; said one.
&quot;Morale is dying,&quot; said another. &quot;You just give up after a while and say to hell with it.&quot;
&quot;We hate our management,&quot; said another. &quot;We don&apos;t even speak to them any more.&quot;
&quot;We do just as much as we&apos;re required to do and no more,&quot; said another.
A Flight Attendants&apos; Association senior executive says he is wary of speaking out.
&quot;It hasn&apos;t been a pleasant restructure and I don&apos;t want to jeopardise anything,&quot; he said.
According to Neil Perry of Rockpool fame, hired by Qantas to overhaul cabin service, things are about to improve. First-class has just begun its new Perry-inspired service with business and economy due next year.
We can only hope.
Australians have long felt an emotional stake in Qantas.
The unhappiness we feel when we suffer poor service is more than the gripes of a dissatisfied customer. It&apos;s genuine despair at the deterioration of an airline of which we used to be so proud.

			<TEXT>QANTAS has invested $25 million in data-warehousing technology to better understand what makes its passengers tick.
A 350Gb repository tracks an integrated matrix of passenger information, including scheduling travel and registering complaints.
The system is being used to work out the most convenient departure and arrival times for Qantas flights if a second Sydney airport is built at Badgerys Creek.
The project had delivered annual savings of $65 million and revolutionised the way the airline perceived itself, Qantas executive general manager, corporate services David Burden said.
&quot;Qantas had to get a better understanding of its products and distribution, and move to a new management perspective,&quot; he said.
What began as a commercial database of financials, bookings and tickets is now a data-warehouse project that receives live feeds from seven independent data sources holding more than 20 million bookings, 200 million passenger segments, 15 million tickets and 600,000 flights.
Most recently, Qantas has spent $7 million upgrading its datawarehouse platform from proprietary to open systems to improve performance with the aim of having more users online with the purchase of an NCR 5100.
&quot;In the past, Qantas never paid attention to the profile of the customer, or what they wanted. That has changed,&quot; Mr Burden said.
&quot;We have moved from running the airline from an operation perspective with excellent in-flight service, to a customer-focused organisation, putting specific effort into who the customer is, how often they travel, where they travel and why.
&quot;It&apos;s created the ability to look across a number of different systems and taught us to start making deductions about why passengers make decisions to choose to fly Qantas rather than our competitors.&quot;

			<TEXT>THE airline industry could face a major shake-up next year after the Federal Government yesterday launched a nine-month inquiry into the tangled network of international air agreements.
Peter Costello announced the tariff-busting Industry Commission would conduct the inquiry into 50 international air service agreements signed by Australia.
More than 3000 bilateral aviation treaties worldwide dictate where airlines can fly and how often, as part of a global carve-up of international air routes.
Under the Australian system, the International Air Services Commission allocates the agreed passenger and freight routes to different air carriers including Qantas and Ansett.
In the terms of reference issued by the Treasurer, the IC was told to focus the inquiry on parts of the framework of international airline regulations which restricted competition.
Mr Costello said the IC would report on the benefits, costs and overall effects of the international aviation regulatory framework and Australia&apos;s approach to negotiating bilateral air service agreements for tourism, consumers, air freight and the aviation industry.
The commission would also look at the effect on competition of the air service arrangements and the possibilities for greater liberalisation, including options for replacing the bilateral system.
&quot;The IC will shortly release an issues paper and invite expressions of interest from parties wanting to participate in the inquiry,&quot; Mr Costello said.
&quot;I encourage all interested parties to make submissions to the commission and to attend public hearings.&quot;

			<TEXT>WHAT on Earth has happened to Qantas? Australia&apos;s national airline must have the rudest flight attendants in the world.
Insiders say Qantas takes Australian passengers for granted, figuring they&apos;ll fly the airline for safety and patriotic reasons. But the quality of cabin service has fallen so low that the priceless Qantas name is starting to lose its shine.
On a flight from the US last week in a jam-packed economy cabin, it was obvious from the start we were in for a harrowing time when the flight service director informed passengers it would be a long flight and the crew would try to make it less awful. What a welcome.
Passengers were treated with disdain.
Food was plonked unceremoniously on our tables by flight attendants busy conducting loud private conversations with each other about their social lives. The snail-paced attendants in our aisle seemed to have hangovers, although there was one valiant woman working double duty trying to make up for her slack colleagues.
We received our &quot;meals&quot; as the people on the other side of the plane were being served after-dinner coffee top-ups.
No one expects gourmet tucker in economy, but you hope for something better than frozen butter, stale bread rolls and a pasta and eggplant dish so tasteless it was inedible.
Having flown this year quite happily with British Airways, Thai Airways and American Airlines, the sub-standard service on Qantas was striking.
When the cabin was darkened a few hours out of LA, the sound of chattering staff and giggles from the brightly-lit galleys made it difficult to sleep.
But being abruptly woken as trolleys slammed into my seat was too much. Later during &quot;sleep-time&quot; at least four closed trolleys were wheeled noisily from one end of the cabin to the other and then, for some reason, wheeled straight back again.
Maybe my tolerance was low because I was squashed next to a family of obese, inanely nattering hillbillies.
But it&apos;s not just me.
Rene Rivkin, in his weekly stock market newsletter a fortnight ago, advised his subscribers to sell Qantas shares.
&quot;Not long ago Qantas was my airline of choice,&quot; he wrote. &quot;And now it (has) become my airline of no-choice!
&quot;... this airline is getting worse and worse.
&quot;I hate to say this, but unless they lift their game they will continue to lose business. Their share price, which I&apos;ve been negative about for quite some time, will take even longer to recover when it does finally do so.&quot;
Yesterday, Rivkin said: &quot;Qantas has lost me as a customer.
&quot;British Airways is marvellous. Cathay is marvellous, Malaysian is marvellous. But Qantas is abysmal. It&apos;s just amateur hour.&quot; On a trip to Melbourne recently to watch a soccer match, Rivkin says his flight was so late he missed the pre-match dinner. On his return trip, he was chastised by Qantas staff at the check-in counter for arriving only half an hour before the scheduled departure time. The plane was delayed an hour, anyway, and waiting passengers were given no explanatory announcement.
Rivkin thinks the problem with Qantas is over-zealous costcutting: even the amount of caviar served in first class has been reduced.
If Qantas first-class passengers think they&apos;re doing it tough, let them try sitting at the back of the bus - $2000 is a lot of money to be treated like a pig in a pen for 14 hours.
According to flight attendant friends, morale at Qantas has plummeted to an all-time low. It&apos;s not uncommon, they say, to come home after a flight to find a message on your answering machine telling you your rostered days off have been cancelled. The situation is no better among flight crews, according to one pilot, who has been advising friends for 12 months to sell Qantas shares.
&quot;The morale is down all over the place,&quot; he says. &quot;All we are now is a number. To me the management don&apos;t care. They think they don&apos;t have to pander to Australians because they&apos;ll always fly Qantas for safety.
&quot;Maintenance (of the planes) is safe but we&apos;re carrying unserviceabilities all the time: all the little things that used to be fixed.&quot;
For instance, he says, the breakdown of a dishwasher at Sydney airport last week delayed dozens of flights.
Layovers for flight crews are also being reduced to a minimum, he says.
&quot;They expect you to arrive in London at 6am and get enough rest but it&apos;s impossible to get your body clock organised to get your eight hours&apos; sleep. After a seven-day London trip you&apos;re coming back fairly tired and they&apos;re still able to turn us around in two days. It&apos;s all within the law, but they&apos;re stretching the ethics of the thing.&quot;
Gary Pemberton, Qantas chairman, was quoted recently complaining jokingly that &quot;everywhere you go, somebody is into your ear about their baggage, their seat, their meal&quot;.
Maybe he should listen.

			<TEXT>AIRLINE unions last night were expected to hand-deliver a resolution to the United Arab Emirates ambassador calling on his Government to stop supporting the stevedore training of alleged &quot;industrial mercenaries&quot; after delaying his flight at Melbourne Airport.
The Transport Workers Union and the Australian Services Union also delayed the flight of a third contingent of workers, believed to be serving and retired army personnel who left Perth last night.
The action came as Patrick stevedores and the Maritime Union of Australia yesterday said they were facing a confrontation unless last-minute talks averted conflict in Melbourne and Sydney over company plans to introduce changes at both ports on Monday.
TWU national secretary John Allan said his union and the ASU had resolved to support the MUA and obstruct the trainees.
Mr Allan said any reaction by Qantas, which supplies the first leg of the Air Emirates flight to Dubai, would widen the dispute.
He said the letters to Mr Khalifa Bakhit Al-Falasi expressed the union movement&apos;s anger at the training being conducted by the Dubai Port Authority.
&quot;This is the first shot across the bow in an ongoing campaign co-ordinated by the ACTU,&quot; he said.
But acting Workplace Relations Minister Richard Alston yesterday dismissed as &quot;second-hand scuttlebutt&quot; and bar talk Opposition and union claims that the soldiers would be used as strikebreakers in a waterfront dispute next April.
Fynwest, the organiser of the training of about 70 workers, part of a planned squad of more than 250, insists the workers will be employed by an Asian company but may end up in Australia.
A new waterfront entrant could legitimately hire new workers to run its Australian operations.
P&amp;0 Ports has told the MUA it will not hire the workers while the Chinese-based OOCL, which wants to start operations next year, says it does not know of the scheme.
Patrick chairman Chris Corrigan has said while he has no problem with the concept of hiring a new workforce, his company has no involvement and will continue to negotiate agreements with its employees and their unions.
Patrick management yesterday said its looming dispute followed proposed changes to rosters and the introduction of new technology in Sydney and Melbourne agreed to by the union in enterprise agreements signed in April this year and December last year.
Patrick says the changes in Melbourne are required to stem losses of $3.5 million since April and a 25 per cent drop in productivity in the face of competition from P&amp;O and a revitalised Strangs group.
It is also understood there has been price-cutting among stevedores, further eroding profits.
But the MUA believes the proposed roster changes in Melbourne go further than had been agreed and the technology changes in Sydney need more planning for safety reasons.

			<TEXT>Qantas has travelled a long way in 50 years. Mike Smith traces its route. Fifty years ago, in the drizzly darkness of a sultry Sydney night, a sleek Lockheed Constellation 749 aircraft taxied out to the runway of Mascot to begin what was to become known as the kangaroo route.
It was the first fully Qantas-operated service to London and more than 1000 people - official guests, airline staff and onlookers - were there to farewell the 11 crew and 29 passengers on &quot;the longest hop&quot;. The aircraft, designed by the eccentric American millionaire Howard Hughes, was christened Charles Kingsford Smith, after the great Australian aviator, and there was great excitement as it gathered speed and lifted off in the rain.
The Qantas service was carrying passengers who had paid around pound stg. 325 for a one-way ticket, as well as food parcels for Britain, which was suffering post-war shortages.
Speaking this week at the kangaroo route&apos;s 50th anniversary black tie dinner, inside one of the hangars at Sydney Airport, Qantas managing director James Strong said: &quot;Mist trailed away behind the four engines,
lingering for a while in the humid summer air as the Constellation climbed towards its cruising speed.
&quot;For Qantas - and Australia - a moment in history had arrived.
&quot;The Constellation changed the level of Australia&apos;s accessibility to the world at large.&quot; To celebrate the golden anniversary of the kangaroo route, a coffee table book entitled The Longest Hop was written by John Stackhouse. He previously compiled information for the glossy publication From the Dawn of Aviation: The Qantas Story 1920-95.
It took the Constellation around 93.5 hours to complete the inaugural journey to London (56 hours in the air), a distance of about 19,130km.
Assisted by a tail wind, the return journey took 84 hours.
The trip compared favourably with the previous flights by the flying boats, where it took one week and 14 stops to get from Sydney to London.
Prior to the service, Qantas had flown to Singapore, where it linked with Imperial Airways (the predecessor of BOAC and British Airways) to complete the journey to London.
The first leg on the historic 1947 &quot;first hop&quot; was a 3500km non-stop flight to Darwin, which arrived shortly after dawn. It then flew to Singapore, Calcutta, Karachi, Cairo and Tripoli, before finally making its way to London. Only the wealthy could afford a seat because the weekly wage in 1947 was just pound stg. 7. By today&apos;s standards, a pound stg. 325 ticket translates to an outlay of around $75,000.
Air travel is a very different story today, with a direct Qantas 747-400 flight taking as little as 22 hours to reach London (with one stopover), and return tickets purchased from under $2000 (depending on season).
Sitting gracefully in the hangar at the anniversary dinner, reminding guests of Qantas&apos;s pioneering past, was a Lockheed L1049-F Super Constellation. The aircraft was found in a desolate part of the US, restored and delivered here at great cost for Australians to enjoy and admire.
The new owner, the Historical Aircraft Restoration Society, proudly showed off the aircraft which superseded the 1947 model and transported passengers on the kangaroo route in the 1950s.
It also played a major role in Australia&apos;s aviation history, which, for Qantas, began in the outback Queensland town of Longreach, a name synonymous with today&apos;s longhaul fleet.
To order a copy of John Stackhouse&apos;s book The Longest Hop for Christmas, call 1800 628 866. It costs $34.95 plus $7 for postage and handling. l To celebrate the 50th anniversary of Qantas&apos;s kangaroo route, we are giving 10 readers the chance to win a copy of The Longest Hop. To enter, write your name and address on the back of an envelope and send to: The Sunday Telegraph Qantas Kangaroo Route Competition, PO Box 940, Strawberry Hills 2013.

			<TEXT>QANTAS and British Airways have been given the go-ahead for a code-sharing arrangement on the Kangaroo route between Sydney and London, via Singapore.
The International Air Services Commission gave the deal a green light after previously foreshadowing the application would be rejected.
The IASC said in its initial finding it was concerned that such an arrangement would mean &quot;public benefits overall would be reduced&quot;. But IASC chairman Jim Bain said yesterday the commission had reviewed its decision after receiving further submissions from the Queensland Government, the Federal Office of National Tourism and other tourism bodies.
&quot;This additional information tipped the balance in favour of the commission approving the code share,&quot; Mr Bain said.
The commission said the new information included: l The strong support from within the tourism sector for the code share.
l Confirmation from both airlines that the code share was essential to achieving the benefits originally expected from their joint services agreement.
Qantas will now be able to sell seats on 12 British Airways services a week, while British Airways can sell seats on 29 Qantas services each week.
From March next year that will rise to 14 and 34 respectively.
The code-share flights will be available from Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Cairns and Darwin.
Qantas general manager, commercial, Geoff Dixon said the codesharing would help develop tourism in both Australia and Britain.
The IASC rejected a similar code-share regime through Bangkok, but Qantas said it was confident the scheme would be approved.

			<TEXT>THE growth in air travel in Asia has prompted an increased demand for commercial pilots. The major airlines have recognised the excellent training available in Australia and as such have shown a preference for locallytrained pilots.
Navair International Flying College has focussed on training pilots to meet the demands of airlines in the region.
Graduates of Navair are flying for major operators throughout Asia such as Qantas and Singapore Airlines.
For students who have taken their Higher School Certificate in 1997, Navair is offering free airline trainee assessment flights and career briefings throughout December.
The briefings, which parents are encouraged to attend, will be held at Navair and will outline student entry requirements before they embark on an aviation career.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIAN air Express will not be the only business to move its operational hub out of NSW because of problems with Sydney airport, chief executive Allen Buckley predicts.
AaE this week announced it would expand its Brisbane base to make it the group&apos;s operational hub, as part of a $1 million investment at the site.
Mr Buckley said AaE, a joint venture between Qantas and Australia Post, had chosen Brisbane over the country&apos;s biggest airport, Sydney, because of the restrictive nature of the regime there.
&quot;We are, of course, heavily involved at Sydney airport, but the truth of the matter is Sydney simply cannot provide for us what we need for a major overnight freight service,&quot; Mr Buckley said.
Aircraft cannot operate into Sydney between 11pm and 6am because of noise issues.
Brisbane, by contrast has no curfew limitations.
AaE&apos;s major aircraft, two Boeing 727s, also are unable to fly into Sydney because of noise restrictions, even though both have been &quot;hush kitted&quot;. &quot;We would love nothing better than to put that aircraft into Sydney,&quot; Mr Buckley said.
Instead, AaE must rely on its fleet of three British Aerospace 146-100s to service Sydney. They carry about 12 tonnes of cargo compared with the 19 tonnes carried by the 727.
AaE&apos;s decision to invest in Brisbane will come as a blow to Sydney airport&apos;s chief executive Tony Stuart who has campaigned to bring more freight through Sydney and to combine the rail, sea and air transport network around the airport and Port Botany region more efficiently.
Mr Stuart this week told a NSW State Chamber of Commerce luncheon that freight had been the &quot;poor cousin&quot; at Sydney airport.
&quot;If we are not careful, we will lose our way in that market,&quot; he said.
He advocated the lifting of the curfews in certain circumstances as happened at some of the world&apos;s biggest airports, including London&apos;s Heathrow, to help with flexibility and attract more business.
He also conceded that additional land in Sydney needed by air freight companies to expand would be difficult and expensive to acquire.
Mr Buckley said the land issue and the opportunity to expand were contributing factors to AaE&apos;s decision to develop Brisbane.
Brisbane airport has about 300ha available for development, and has designated a further 40ha near the international terminal as a freight precinct.
AaE&apos;s expansion means it will now operate 40 night flights to and from Brisbane, up from 24 previously, carrying 380 tonnes of cargo a week from 184 tonnes.
Mr Buckley said AaE would now be able to drive up its market share in the $1.3 billion domestic freight market to challenge established players Ansett Air Freight and Mayne Nickless.
He estimated that AaE now controls about 20 per cent of the market, but that would grow to 40 per cent during the next five years.
&quot;We see ourselves as being the dominant air freight operator in Australia,&quot; he said.

			<TEXT>RIVALRY between airlines appeared to reach new heights when Ansett aircraft sabotaged a speech by Qantas supremo James Strong - twice.
More than 500 eager listeners, including sprinter Cathy Freeman, musicians&apos; mate Richard Wilkins, sexpert Tottie Goldsmith and police chief Peter Ryan, gathered in an airport hangar to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Kangaroo Route linking London and Sydney.
But no sooner had Strong welcomed his guests than one Ansett jet roared past, followed by a second when he tried to resume his oration.
When his efforts were interrupted a third time, the black-tie revellers roared in appreciation the offending jet was one of Qantas&apos;s own.

			<TEXT>A POWER failure at Sydney airport caused Qantas international flights to be delayed by up to two hours yesterday, a Qantas spokeswoman said.
A blackout in the Qantas catering centre had a &quot;snowball&quot; effect and caused delays in getting food and beverages to the aircraft, she said.
The blackout occurred yesterday morning in the catering centre which under renovation. The problem was expected to be rectified last night with flight back on schedule.

			<TEXT>QANTAS Airways says its travel business will get harder because of the Asian currency crisis.
Chairman Gary Pemberton said yesterday Qantas&apos; domestic business would be hit by the reduction but did not indicate by how much.
&quot;There&apos;ll be a lot of cheap fares to take Australian people out of our tourist sector into the devalued economies of Asia so I think there&apos;ll be strong competition from Asian holidays against our domestic industry,&quot; Mr Pemberton told Business Sunday.
He said Qantas had previously benefited from a strong domestic tourism market that was &quot;perceived&quot; to have been boosted by greater capacity from Asian airlines coming into Australia. Those airlines were now likely to have surplus capacity that could be filled by offering cheap fares to Australian tourists.
The currency devaluations had not affected Qantas&apos; earnings too much yet but it was having some difficulty in &quot;anticipating the future direction of those effects&quot;. Qantas earlier indicated its earnings this year would match or better last year&apos;s net result of $252.7 million.
Mr Pemberton told shareholders at its annual meeting that profits from Qantas&apos;s Asian operations would be maintained or marginally improve, not even taking into account possible further deterioration in the market.

			<TEXT>A TRAVELLER planning to fly to London 50 years ago would have had to put aside the best part of a week just to get there, and fork out the cost of half a suburban home.
Today, the same flight can be done for well under $2000 and take only about 24 hours.
On December 1, 1947 the first Qantas flight from Sydney to London took off at 10pm in drizzling rain watched by 1000 people at Mascot Airport.
It was the first flight by an Australian airline that had set off for what was still known as the &quot;mother country&quot;. The aircraft was a Lockheed Constellation, designed by the eccentric American millionaire Howard Hughes, and reputedly one of the finest of the pre-jet age aircraft.
Previously, Qantas had flown to Singapore where it linked up with Imperial Airways (the predecessor of BOAC and British Airways) that completed the journey to London.
The inaugural Qantas flight took four and a half days, including 55 hours in the air, and carried 29 passengers and 11 crew.
It stopped at Darwin, Singapore, Calcutta, Karachi, Cairo and Tripoli before finally winding its way to London.
The cost was pound stg. 325 for a one-way ticket, at the time when the average weekly wage was about pound stg. 7.
In today&apos;s terms, the affluent passengers outlaid about $75,000 for the trip, according to John Stackhouse, author of the Longest Hop: Celebrating 50 Years of the Qantas Kangaroo Route.
The return flight from London to Sydney, undertaken on December 7, sparked the imagination and a lifelong devotion to flying of Roger Eames, who was only five at the time.
At the time Eames and his family were scheduled to leave London to emigrate to New Zealand, only to find the ship had been double-booked, prompting a mad dash by his father to a nearby Qantas office.
Eames said his strongest memories were of walking across the snow-covered tarmac to the silver Lockheed Constellation.
&quot;I could not believe we were going to fly half way across the world in that thing,&quot; Mr Eames remembers.
In an effort to ward off the boredom, Eames&apos;s father bought him dinky toys to play with in the aisles.
Eames said the novelty of the flight kept him enthralled the whole way.
&quot;I definitely didn&apos;t find it boring. I loved it.&quot;

			<TEXT>QANTAS yesterday unveiled plans to spend $150 million revamping its 29 Boeing 747 fleet.
The aircraft upgrade is part of $560 million capital expenditure program previously flagged by the company.
The plans will deliver a much needed boost to Victoria&apos;s Avalon airport creating 120 jobs for two years and delivering about $30 million in wages to the region.
Qantas chief executive James Strong said the 747 refit included installing luxurious sleeper seats in first class, electronically adjustable seats in business class, and more comfortable economy seats.
It will also include new kitchens and toilets.
Each aircraft will require about 10,000 hours of work. Mr Strong said the contract was good for Qantas because Avalon was so close to its main airports of Melbourne and Sydney.
The remainder of the $560 million program is to be spent on various items, including an in-flight entertainment program.
Qantas shares jumped 13 cents to $2.63 yesterday, recovering some of the territory because of fears profits would be hit by the Asian crisis.

			<TEXT>QANTAS is to spend $150 million on a fitout of the interior of its 29 Boeing 747 planes as part of a broader $560 million program outlined earlier this year.
Qantas said yesterday the work would be done at Avalon airport, between Melbourne and Geelong, by 120 workers from Forstaff and 12 Qantas supervisors at a labour and site cost of $30 million.
Qantas chief executive James Strong said the company was using Avalon because it was near its operational bases in Melbourne and Sydney without disrupting ongoing heavy maintenance operations, and came after an &quot;extensive and competitive&quot; world search for facilities.
The reconfiguration program will include installation of new sleeper seats in first class, electronically adjustable seats in business class and a new design in economy class seats.
The cabins will be redecorated and fitted with new galleys and toilets, with the program to involve about 10,000 man-hours an aircraft.
The program will start next April and continue for almost two years, with the first plane to enter service in early May 1998.
A Qantas spokesman said the remainder of the $560 million program would be spent on various items, including an in-flight entertainment program.
It was anticipated at the time of the May announcement of the program that $320 million of that money would be spent on an in-built video system to be installed in the back of seats.
Qantas was in discussions with government about allowing gambling via the system on international flights.
Qantas shares jumped 13 cents to $2.63 yesterday.

			<TEXT>A PASSENGER plane carrying 22 people and a light aircraft came within 200m of a mid-air collision in the state&apos;s north-west, it was revealed yesterday.
The Qantas-run Eastern Airlines flight was forced to take immediate evasive action when a Piper Navajo, flying at 7500ft, flew into its path.
The airline flight from Sydney was descending into Narrabri when the incident occurred about 7.30am Monday. No one was injured and the aircraft landed safely.
Community and Public Sector Union aviation section secretary Adrian O&apos;Connell said the near-collision revealed serious problems in airspace management in Australia - problems he said would get worse with the introduction of the proposed Airspace 2000 model.
But acting Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) chairman Dick Smith said the new regulations would be more onerous and provide a safer airspace.
Mr O&apos;Connell said that at the speed aircraft travel, a miss of just 200m was &quot;extremely close&quot;. Qantas, CASA and Bureau of Air Safety Investigations all confirmed the near-collision had occurred and said it was under investigation by BASI.
The incident was reported by the pilot of the Eastern flight, who had contacted air traffic control moments before descending into Narrabri to check on the presence of other craft.
But under current airspace management rules, controllers had no way of knowing if other aircraft such as the Navajo were in the area.

			<TEXT>AN air-safety investigation is under way after a descending Qantas aircraft flew close to an oncoming Piper Navajo in north-western NSW this week.
The Qantas Eastern aircraft, carrying 22 passengers, was forced to take corrective action after flying within 200m of the plane as it tried to land at Narrabri Airport.
Airservices Australia confirmed the incident, saying the Qantas pilot had to take evasive action to avoid hitting the other aircraft.
The incident prompted an inquiry by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation. A report will be made early next year.
The Qantas pilot has filed a report to BASI investigators.
The incident prompted warnings by the Community and Public Sector Union about declining air safety standards in Australia.
CPSU secretary Adrian O&apos;Connell said the incident highlighted industry concerns about changes to the management of non-radar airspace under a plan called Airspace 2000.
Mr O&apos;Connell said aircraft flying with visual flight rules did not have to report their presence in airspace below 8000 feet.
Under Airspace 2000, conceived by pilot Dick Smith with assistance from Air Services and CASA experts, aircraft would not need to identify themselves below 20,000 feet.
He said Airspace 2000 would increase the risk of a &quot;major mid-air collision&quot;. &quot;It is a tragic but unavoidable conclusion,&quot; he said.
An Airservices Australia spokesman rejected the warning, saying Airspace 2000 would not have affected procedures in Narrabri. The Qantas plane had been travelling at about 8000 feet and had not been within radar range.
The spokesman said it had not been established whether the incident had been caused by pilot error or by a breakdown in separation.
Qantas Eastern flight 62 had been en route from Sydney on Monday morning and had been attempting to land in Narrabri when the incident occurred. The other aircraft had been en route to Tamworth from Wee Waa when the Qantas flight entered its air space.
The Qantas aircraft landed at Narrabri at 7.50am.

			<TEXT>THE former Qantas apprentices who were told they should be reinstated after their axing in May say their victory is bitter-sweet.
The airline has appealed against an Industrial Relations Commission order to reinstate Derek Hennessy, Stephen Fetz and Wayne Duhigg, leaving the former apprentices in the dark once again.
But at least there is hope. The effect of the David and Goliath victory will not wear off too quickly for the former apprentices.
&quot;I was over the moon,&quot; said Derek Hennessy. &quot;I didn&apos;t think it was going to happen.
&quot;I thought a big corporation like that would win. There was only three of us. It&apos;s just a shame the other 50 didn&apos;t go for it.&quot;
Qantas axed 53 apprentices just before they graduated in May this year to save costs.
The airline&apos;s actions were found to be &quot;harsh, unjust and unreasonable&quot; by IRC vice president Ian Ross.
Derek, who trained as a sheet metal worker at Qantas, has been working as a labourer.
&quot;It&apos;s been pretty heartbreaking,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;ve taken a big pay drop as well. I&apos;m working as a tradesman and not even in my trade.&quot;
Both Stephen and Derek said they would consider taking their skills overseas if the airline was successful in its appeal. &quot;But we do want to go back to Qantas,&quot; Stephen said.
Stephen, who trained as a mechanical engineer, has been working on earthmoving equipment for the past five months after applying to three smaller aircraft companies for work.
He said the decision was a true victory over the airline &quot;but we can&apos;t get too carried away with it&quot;. The airline&apos;s appeal is even more baffling for the apprentices in light of a staff vacancy list all 53 received last week.
The list detailed almost 90 positions with Qantas in either Sydney or Melbourne.
&quot;The whole argument in the beginning was that there were no positions,&quot; Stephen said.

			<TEXT>MORE than 1200 Qantas workers at Sydney Airport could go on strike in protest against the airline&apos;s decision this week to jettison plans to hire 100 engineering and maintenance apprentices next year.
State organiser of the NSW branch of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union Adam Kerslake yesterday refused to rule out industrial action following a meeting of 30 union delegates at the airport on Wednesday.
&quot;We will consider all our options - that could go to striking and mass meetings,&quot; Mr Kerslake said.
&quot;We will do what we can to support our members who are apprentices and ensure that the intake of apprentices is not interfered with politically.
&quot;This is a serious issue and we want to communicate this to our delegates and let them decide.&quot; On Thursday, Qantas chairman Gary Pemberton announced the airline had &quot;no choice&quot; but to suspend its 1998 engineering and maintenance apprenticeship intake after the Industrial Relations Committee ordered the company to reinstate three final-year apprentices it sacked along with 50 other apprentices in May.
IRC vice-president Iain Ross said Qantas&apos;s decision to dump the apprentices was &quot;harsh, unjust and unreasonable&quot; and found there was no valid reason for the dismissal.
Mr Ross ordered the former apprentices - Derek Hennessy, Wayne Duhigg and Stephen Fetz - be reinstated in the maintenance and engineering division with no loss of seniority.
Qantas will appeal the decision before the full bench of the IRC.
Mr Pemberton said the IRC ruling had created a climate of uncertainty by putting &quot;an ominous question mark&quot; over Australia&apos;s apprenticeship system.
&quot;The question now is what employer, large or small, will want to offer apprenticeships if this finding means that they will then automatically have to provide jobs for them when they have completed their indentures,&quot; he said.
&quot;If the IRC decision holds it could mean that to offer permanent employment to graduating apprentices we would have to make experienced tradespeople - many of them with wives and families - redundant.&quot;
Mr Pemberton defended Qantas&apos;s efforts in employing young Australians, saying the company had provided aviation industry training for more than 6000 young people since it began its engineering and maintenance apprenticeship program in 1927.
He said Qantas believed apprenticeships constituted a training system and advised apprentices &quot;at the outset&quot; there was no guarantee of permanent employment when they completed their indentures.
But AMWU State secretary Paul Bastian said Qantas had made representations to apprentices at their enrolment and during their employment that there was a &quot;reasonable expectation&quot; a job would exist for them when they finished their indentures.
&quot;In these circumstances, the decision to reinstate was the correct one, and no amount of politics played with the careers of young people will alter the fact that the original decision taken by Qantas to unilaterally terminate 53 apprenticeships was manifestly unfair,&quot; he said.
Mr Kerslake said the AMWU expected that John Howard and federal Industrial Relations Minister Peter Reith would &quot;come out on the side of Qantas&quot; and use the issue to push for the abolition of unfair dismissal laws.
But he warned the AMWU would fight tooth and nail for the apprentices&apos; rights.
&quot;We believe that apprentices have a right to access the current unfair dismissal laws, but we are concerned Qantas will attempt to undermine that position and use the IRC decision to cancel out these rights,&quot; he said.
&quot;Our view is that people should have these rights because they are part of our international obligation - it&apos;s a human rights issue.&quot;

			<TEXT>ANGRY shareholders yesterday criticised the bosses of three of Australia&apos;s leading businesses over their lucrative salary and share packages. AMP&apos;s American chief executive George Trumbull bore most anger over his unprecedented gift of $10 million worth of free shares on top of his $2.5 million annual salary.
However, Coles Myer&apos;s Californian chief executive Dennis Eck and Western Mining boss Hugh Morgan also faced criticism over lucrative share schemes which could also earn them millions of dollars.
And in Perth at the Qantas annual meeting, shareholders forced the blue-chip board to take a poll on a proposal to lift the total non-executive directors&apos; fees from $600,000 to $750,000.
After facing an onslaught from AMP policyholders in Sydney, Mr Trumbull said members quibbling over the number of shares allocated to them in AMP&apos;s $10 billion demutualisation were greedy.
&quot;We have at least a couple of those people that ... happen to have a different view on share allocations because, there is a five letter word that begins in G and ends in D,&quot; he said.
AMP policyholders voting on whether to demutualise the AMP Society had earlier fired a round of criticism at the board over the granting of a million free shares to Mr Trumbull over the next three years.
One vocal member described him as &quot;George `Grab-all&apos; Trumbull&quot; and the deal as &quot;the despicable and deceitful behind-our-backs obscene and outrageous golden handshake&quot;. &quot;Mr Trumbull is grabbing approximately a $10 million free,&quot; the policyholder said.
In reply, Mr Trumbull said he did not negotiate the deal with the board and jokingly suggested he should have aimed for a higher payout.
Chairman Ian Burgess tried to explain that Mr Trumbull must meet performance targets before earning the payout.
&quot;The Australian business community is part of the international business community and you&apos;ve got to be competitive,&quot; Mr Burgess said.
&quot;Even in hindsight I am unrepentant. I was chairman of the board that decided this and I think it was a proper result.&quot; At the Coles Myer annual meeting in Melbourne, former chief executive Peter Bartels came in for even more criticism than Mr Eck over his $3.7 million payout for just six months&apos; work last year.
&quot;It is almost obscene that people can destroy wealth and still walk away with $3.7 million,&quot; one shareholder said.
While Mr Eck was generally welcomed for lifting Coles Myer&apos;s performance, his $3.3 million salary and $40 million share options deal drew fire.
&quot;The increases in the amounts payable to senior executives is getting out of all proportion to the capabilities of this company to accommodate their needs,&quot; one shareholder said.
WMC&apos;s managing director Hugh Morgan faced shareholder anger over its tumbling share price and weak profits.
Unhappy shareholders deprived the company of the 75 per cent majority needed by a show of hands to issue Mr Morgan with 375,000 options. The motion was passed in a formal poll.
HUGH MORGAN Managing director WMC $1.3 million Salary $1.29m; 375,000 options over $5 shares `(C)The proposed performance hurdles is ludicrously inadequate ... with the WMC share price so low, it is no real hurdle at all &apos; Australian Shareholders Associations&apos;s Julian Stock

			<TEXT>QANTAS Airways has conceded that the ongoing tumult in Asian currency markets will hit revenue this year, but is still predicting that it can at least match last year&apos;s profit.
Chairman Gary Pemberton told shareholders at yesterday&apos;s annual meeting in Perth: &quot;Much has been said about the potential impact of Asian conditions on the Qantas full-year profit outlook.
&quot;At this stage, and notwithstanding Asian developments, it is still our expectation to deliver a profit at, or above, last year.&quot;
Last year, Qantas reported a full-year profit of $252.7 million, a 2.6 per cent rise on the previous year, as revenue rose 3.1 per cent to $7.83 billion. Mr Pemberton said the worst affected region had been SouthEast Asia, including Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia. These countries produce about 6 per cent of Qantas&apos; revenue passenger kilometres.
But Mr Pemberton said the North Asian countries, such as Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan, which account for a similar level of revenue, were also likely to decline.
Japan, which has recorded diminishing growth over the past 18 months, continued to trend downwards but chief executive James Strong was hopeful that could be reversed.
Mr Pemberton said the full effect of the Asian downturn could not yet be quantified, but insisted that the profit forecast was a &quot;conservative view of current projections and makes some allowance for possible further deterioration&quot;. He was confident any shortfall in Asian revenue could be made up by growth elsewhere.
Domestically, Qantas was ahead of this time last year, even though the local market continued to be flat, and that the traditional markets of the United States and the United Kingdom continued to perform well.
Mr Pemberton also said traffic to Asia from Australia was likely to increase, as Asian destinations became relatively cheaper for tourists.
Qantas shares closed 1c lower yesterday at $2.51.

			<TEXT>A PRICE war has erupted between Qantas, Ansett and Cathay Pacific after the Hong Kong airline slashed prices on flights to the Special Administrative Region.
Late last week, Cathay said it was introducing a &quot;Super Offer&quot; on flights to Hong Kong in an effort to boost flagging tourism to the region.
It is offering two economyclass return tickets for the price of one and is including also 31/2 nights&apos; accommodation.
The low-price offer is designed to encourage more tourists to visit Hong Kong, which has seen visitors sharply decline since the Chinese resumed control of the former British colony on July 1.
It has also suffered a decline in tourists from the rest of Asia, a pattern thought to be linked to the continuing currency turmoil in the region.
Cathay says it hopes the offer will attract 20,000 visitors to Hong Kong from around the world.
Deputy managing director Philip Chen said: &quot;We are aiming at revitalising the excitement surrounding Hong Kong as a destination.
&quot;Hong Kong received the lion&apos;s share of international press coverage in the past year but recently people seem to have focused on other destinations.&quot;
Almost 3000 seats will be available from Australia, from all six international gateway airports, with tickets on sale until November 27, for travel between January 10 and February 15.
Prices will start at $1119 for two people compared with a normal cost of $1359 a person.
Qantas has replied with its own deal: two packages which it says will offer savings of as much as 50 per cent for travellers.
The first is priced at $559 a person, leaving from Brisbane, Melbourne or Sydney, and includes return economy airfares plus three nights&apos; accommodation. It is on sale until November 28, with travel to be taken between January 15 and January 30, or February 15 until March 15.
The second package, aimed at travellers with children, includes adult fares starting at $699 and children at $469, plus accommodation for two nights.
Ansett also has joined the fray, offering seats for travel agents to on-sell for less than $500, as well as offering its own packages.
For $699, Ansett is offering return air fares to Hong Kong, plus four nights&apos;accommodation.
The package is on sale until November 30 and flights must be taken between January 13 and January 28 or February 11 and March 22.
The week between the two dates includes Chinese New Year, a time when all carriers traditionally have a healthy load factor.

			<TEXT>DEREK Hennessy - one of the apprentices Qantas was ordered to reinstate - said last night he was &quot;overjoyed&quot; at the decision.
&quot;It&apos;s definitely a victory for the little guy. I am really looking forward to working back at Qantas,&quot; the 23-year-old said.
Speaking at his family&apos;s Oyster Bay home in Sydney&apos;s south, Mr Hennessy said he decided to challenge his dismissal &quot;not just for myself but for all the other apprentices coming behind me&quot;. &quot;I&apos;ve tried other jobs but I haven&apos;t found anything that compared with Qantas,&quot; he said.
&quot;I just want my old job back.
&quot;They have even sent me mail showing that they have a vacancy for me, yet they are appealing. I can&apos;t understand it.&quot;

			<TEXT>MORE than six months after Qantas dumped 53 apprentices about to complete a four-year training course, the airline was yesterday ordered to reinstate three of them.
In a 45-page judgment Industrial Relations Commission vicepresident Iain Ross said Qantas&apos; action in terminating the three apprenticeships was &quot;harsh, unjust and unreasonable&quot;. He also found no valid reason existed for the dismissals.
The commission ordered the three be reinstated in the maintenance and engineering division with no loss of seniority.
But the jubilation of apprentices Derek Hennessy, Wayne Duhigg and Stephen Fetz was short-lived, with Qantas last night announcing it would appeal.
Although Qantas advertised maintenance vacancies two weeks ago its general manager for aircraft operations, Doug Gillies, said the company did not have positions to offer the three dismissed apprentices.
When they were sacked in May Australian Manufacturing Workers Union (AMWU) State secretary Paul Bastian accused the airline of treating its workers like &quot;human garbage&quot;. The AMWU supported their nine-month battle for reinstatement. &quot;This decision is a huge black eye for Qantas. It is also a slap in the face for John Howard who is seeking to exclude apprentices from unfair dismissal laws,&quot; Mr Bastian said.
&quot;Qantas set a shocking example in the callous way it terminated its apprentices.&quot;
In a statement Mr Gillies said Qantas would appeal to the full bench of the IRC because the decision had implications for every provider of apprentice training.
&quot;In an environment of high youth unemployment, companies will be more reluctant to offer training if they are obliged to employ graduates at the end of their indenture,&quot; he said.
He said the Qantas appeal would be based on the grounds that the commission&apos;s decision was &quot;fundamentally flawed&quot; and that vicepresident Ross &quot;should have found that the IRC had no jurisdiction&quot;.

			<TEXT>QANTAS has been ordered to reinstate three final-year apprentices whose dreams were shattered when they were treated &quot;harshly, unjustly and unreasonably&quot; and were sacked along with 50 employees six months ago.
Handing down his finding yesterday, Australian Industrial Relations Commission vice-president Iain Ross said it was reasonable for the apprentices to believe their employment would continue after the completion of their four-year apprenticeships.
He found the letters of appointment sent by Qantas to Stephen Fetz, Wayne Duhigg and Derek Hennessy did not state that the contract of employment was for a fouryear term.
&quot;I believed each of the applicants when they said they believed that if they performed well then their employment would continue at the conclusion of their apprenticeship,&quot; he said.
One of the three apprentices, who did not wish to be named, said yesterday he felt vindicated by the commission&apos;s decision.
&quot;When we were sacked, my dreams were shattered and I was upset and depressed,&quot; he said.
&quot;Right from the start, it was my dream to be an engineer and maintenance mechanic for an Australian airline, so the axing came as a complete shock.&quot;
Despite feelings of bitterness towards Qantas, he said he would apply for one of the 90 positions advertised by the national carrier.
Mr Ross said while Qantas had a right to reduce the size of its workforce to improve its competitive position, the selection criteria adopted by management was not applied fairly.
He ordered Qantas to reinstate the three apprentices to a work area to be determined by management.
Qantas dismissed an entire class of apprentice aircraft engineers last May to cut costs.
The move left the group devastated, with the axe falling just two weeks before the 52 young men and one woman were due to graduate.
But in a bizarre twist, Qantas recently advertised for 90 aircraft maintenance engineers and all 53 apprentices laid off by Qantas received the staff vacancy list in the mail.
Australian Manufacturing Workers Union acting secretary general Paul Bastian welcomed the decision and said Qantas &quot;now stands condemned&quot;. &quot;The apprentices should have been given the opportunity to stay on, but instead they were treated indignantly,&quot; he said. &quot;Qantas treated these young kids like cow fodder.&quot;
Qantas employs 500 apprentices in engineering maintenance and 61 in catering. Qantas will appeal the finding.

			<TEXT>THE ANZ Bank is expected to report on Wednesday an improved full year profit, with estimates around $1.3 billion.
The result - the first to be presided over by new chief executive John McFarlane - is expected to show the benefits of ongoing cost cutting at all levels, as well as strong earnings from the investment banking operation.
Because the bank has a lower share of the home lending market than its rivals, the ANZ will be sheltered from the full extent of reduced interest margins from the rate cutting war.
o o o QANTAS shareholders will be looking for answers at Thursday&apos;s annual meeting in Perth about what effect the Asian currency turmoil will have on the airline and whether it still expects to meet forecasts of an improved profit.
Qantas&apos; profit rose 2.6 per cent to $252.7 million last financial year, with sales improving 3.1 per cent to $7.83 billion. At the time, chairman Gary Pemberton predicted a &quot;small improvement&quot; in operating profit this year.
But with Qantas earning nearly half its revenue overseas, and half of that from Asia, shareholders will be keen to determine if that prediction still stands.
One analyst said: &quot;The market remains extremely nervous of the aviation industry, considering the history in the industry of bad losses.&quot;
o o o IT will be the turn of Country Road directors and management to feel the anger of the masses on Thursday when shareholders gather to seek answers about a dismal year for the upmarket clothing and homeware retailer.
Leading the charge will be the Solomon Lew-backed Australian Retail Investments, which owns about 10.3 per cent of Country Road and has been a vociferous critic of management following a 99 per cent plunge in net profit to $122,000 this year.
Adding spice to the meeting will be the takeover offer from the South African-based Woolworths group, which offered $2 a share for Country Road, valuing it at $137 million.
However, the stock has consistently traded above the offer price and ARI and major shareholder Portfolio Partners have labelled the bid too low.
o o o BHP chief executive John Prescott is scheduled on Tuesday to make his first public appearance since the dramatic reorganisation of the company in September.
His will address the Institute of Chartered Accountants on BHP&apos;s strategy for the future, a topic which has not been far from the minds of market observers. Most of BHP&apos;s businesses are the subject of cost cutting reviews since its disastrous $410 million profit earlier in the year. The poor performers have until May to achieve rigorous new benchmarks or they will be slated for sale.
o o o BORAL directors will face not only the expected wrath of green groups today over the company&apos;s logging of old-growth forests in Tasmania but also of the Australian Shareholders Association over Boral&apos;s poor financial performance.
The ASA has sent the building materials and energy group a &quot;please explain&quot; over its 1997 annual report, which it says gives a favourable impression of the 1996-97 result - the company&apos;s second-worst since 1985.
Net profit before abnormals rose only 3.4 per cent, although the bottom line result almost doubled to $403 million thanks to a $226.7 million profit booked from the sale of its Envestra gas pipeline operations. o
o o FOR the first time in many years Coles Myer directors will probably be looking forward to the annual meeting, after a year in which profits improved markedly and the company&apos;s biggest retailer was perceived to get itself back on track.
Stan Wallis will chair his first meeting, to be held in Melbourne on Thursday, which is expected to be much shorter than last year&apos;s 61/2-hour epic in Sydney.
Shareholders will ponder the first major overhaul to the articles of association since the 1970s.
However, the mood is likely to be a bit lighter this year after a 39 per cent rise in net profit to $389.4 million and a share price that has leapt from $4.60 a year ago to $7.43 earlier this month.
One analyst said: &quot;It has been a very, very successful year for Coles and I would think there will be much less controversy this year than last.&quot;
o o o MACQUARIE Bank is expected to show an improved profit for the six months to September 30 when it reports today.
Analysts estimate the bank is heading towards a full year result around $129 million, which would be a 10 per cent increase on its 1996-97 result.
The investment bank has been active in several buoyant markets including infrastructure and privatisation projects. TABLE AVAILABLE / THE NOT SO BIG AUSTRALIAN.

			<TEXT>QANTAS has advertised for more than 60 aircraft maintenance engineers after axing 53 apprentices six months ago.
One of the &quot;essential requirements&quot; for the vacancies is to have completed a relevant apprenticeship.
All engineering and maintenance apprentices laid off by Qantas in May as a cost-cutting measure received the staff vacancy list in the mail last week.
One of the apprentices said they were reluctant to apply to an employer who had shown them the door just two weeks before they graduated from four year&apos;s training.
&quot;A lot of people are very wary of applying,&quot; he said.
&quot;It&apos;s so bizarre. You just can&apos;t explain why they got rid of us six months ago and now they&apos;re looking for the same number of people.
&quot;They must be expecting us to come back.&quot;
Under the agreement with the Industrial Relations Commission, the apprentices were to be informed of any vacancies in Qantas.
The staff vacancy notice obtained by The Sunday Telegraph shows 29 positions vacant in Qantas&apos;s Mascot mechanical division, seven in structures and 27 in avionics.
There are also 12 engineering and maintenance positions with Qantas at Tullamarine Airport in Melbourne.
Former apprentices will be competing against apprentices due to graduate in January and other workers in Qantas whose jobs may be under threat of being lost to contractors.
A Qantas spokesman said there were about 90 positions in total.
Australian Manufacturing Workers Union assistant secretary Robyn Fortescue said the apprentices did have a chance of re-employment but were too concerned about the risk.
&quot;They&apos;re probably quite worried about the same thing happening again if they go back,&quot; Ms Fortescue said.
Decisions will be handed down tomorrow in the cases of three apprentices who took their cases to the Unfair Dismissal Tribunal.
A Qantas spokesman said it was not unusual to have a situation where 54 apprentices were not kept on and then have up to 90 jobs advertised less than a year later because the requirements of the airline were constantly changing. &quot;It&apos;s not a static thing,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s just standard company procedure.&quot;
He said Qantas was currently employing 500 apprentices in engineering maintenance from first to fourth year, and 61 in catering.

			<TEXT>THE Kangaroo Route from Australia to the UK was renowned as one of the longest and most arduous airline trips in the world.
Qantas launched the flight in the mid &apos;40s. It quickly became the cornerstone of its international service, prompting the introduction of a similar flight to America known as &quot;the Southern Cross route&quot;. Qantas&apos;s fledgling fleet of Constellation planes ferried mostly businessmen and diplomats and often made over six stopovers en route to London.
Then, the Kangaroo route (approx 17,000km) took over 35 hours. Today&apos;s planes make the trip in just over 21 hours.

			<TEXT>A NEW 10-year &quot;strategic commercial agreement&quot; covering schedules, fleet coordination, engineering, marketing, ground handling, customers, fuel service and freight was signed by Qantas and its Fiji partner, Air Pacific, yesterday.
Included are code-share agreements, access to frequent-flyer programs, Qantas Holidays products and general sales agent representation.
Qantas has a 17.5 per cent shareholding in Air Pacific and the two airlines have code-share services between Fiji and Australia, Fiji and Los Angeles and, from this week, Fiji and Honolulu.
The Australian and Fijian governments first signed an air services agreement in 1973.
Qantas executive general manager (commercial) Geoff Dixon said the renewed agreement would help maximise cost benefits, efficiency and profitability.
Air Pacific acting chief executive Ramendra Narayan said it would foster the development of tourism to Fiji from Australia, the United States and Europe.
The two airlines will appoint two representatives to a coordinating committee to oversee development of the agreement.

			<TEXT>are doing work that&apos;s not as challenging&apos;
FEWER than a quarter of the 53 Qantas apprentices sacked six months ago have found work back in aircraft maintenance.
And only four have landed jobs with an international airline, working in the field in which they were trained.
Jaimie Ballinger, Keith Daly, Karin Einfalt and Simon Gallagher left their jobs with an industrial supplier last week after winning positions with Air New Zealand in Auckland.
&quot;I&apos;m ecstatic and relieved because I&apos;m back in the industry I was trained for,&quot; said Mr Daly, 22.
&quot;But it&apos;s such a shame that the training that Qantas gave us has to go overseas.&quot; Qantas sacked an entire class of apprentice aircraft engineers in May this year as a cost-cutting measure.
The move left the group devastated, with the axe falling just two weeks before the 52 young men and one woman were due to graduate.
The Air New Zealand group will start work on November 17. Coincidentally, the first jet they will work on will be a Qantas 767.
Mr Ballinger says that, with hindsight, his sacking was a blessing in disguise.
&quot;In the long run I think being forced to take the chance is good,&quot; he said.
&quot;The world is an experience in itself. Being at Qantas you&apos;d never leave to go for a job in New Zealand.
&quot;We&apos;ll be exposed to a lot more variety of planes. At the end of the day, New Zealand is the hot option.&quot;
Most of the other sacked apprentices are grasping at contract work or putting up with jobs in related but different fields.
Former apprentice Wayne Redman has been forced to increase his hours working at a Bondi pub to supplement his income from part-time aircraft maintenance jobs.
&quot;It&apos;s quite difficult if you want to stay in the industry but I&apos;m determined to,&quot; Mr Redman said.
He said about 15 former apprentices were working for a heavy machinery repair firm in Parramatta fixing tractors and bulldozers.
&quot;Everybody&apos;s still very upset at what happened and a lot of them are doing work that&apos;s not as challenging or interesting as what they were trained for.
&quot;In aircraft engineering there&apos;s a lot more faultfinding skills involved than with a truck or bulldozer because aircraft are a lot more complicated.&quot;
Hawker de Havilland, Hawker Pacific, Kendall Airlines, the navy and the air force have also taken on some of the apprentices.
Former apprentice Kane Murray is working for Hawker de Havilland, but instead of doing maintenance, he is making aircraft parts.
&quot;A lot of us are doing the sort of work you wouldn&apos;t do after the way we were trained,&quot; Mr Murray said.
Qantas recently said it would spend $650 million on three new Boeing 747-400 planes. But a spokesman said the aircraft would not be delivered until 1999, so Qantas could not predict maintenance requirements.

			<TEXT>BRYAN Grey, chief of third domestic carrier hopeful Aussie Airlines, signalled he might try to take on Qantas Airways yet again over access to terminal space.
He said the issue was &quot;being dealt with by other people&quot; but declined to comment if that meant his lawyers were pursuing the matter.
Asked when his position regarding an alleged dispute with Qantas would be clearer, Mr Grey said: &quot;I would hope early next week I&apos;ll have some up-todate advice.&quot; He declined to comment on whether Aussie was still pursuing funding for its on-again, off-again plan for a third airline.
Yesterday, the Federal Airports Corp said Mr Grey disputed Qantas&apos; statement to the Australian Stock Exchange on October 10 that Aussie had failed to fulfil its agreement on sub-leases for terminal space at Coolangatta, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney airports.
Qantas said at the time Aussie had not stumped up $10.5 million in deposits by close of business on October 10, pursuant to the agreement.
Australia&apos;s flagship carrier added that the agreements contained a clause &quot;in which Aussie Airlines acknowledged that its failure to satisfy the conditions precedent also resulted in it having no further rights to request Qantas to provide sub-leases of domestic terminal facilities&quot;. Yesterday, FAC managing director and chief executive Barry Murphy said: &quot;Aussie Airlines believe they have in fact met the commitments under the terms of the agreement and perhaps could still provide the financial certainty that would flow pursuant to the agreement.
&quot;Qantas believes that the conditions were not met and Aussie has taken a view, based on advice I&apos;m sure, that they have.&quot;
Mr Murphy was responding to a question at the National Aviation Press Club yesterday on whether Australia&apos;s aviation market had seen the last of Mr Grey. In the early 1990s, Mr Grey headed the failed Compass Airlines which attempted to snatch market share from Qantas and Ansett by undercutting the duo&apos;s fares.
Mr Grey said he had not seen the FAC&apos;s comments.
A spokesman for Qantas said it stood by the position outlined in its letter to the Australian Stock Exchange and would not comment further.
Mr Murphy, who had previously mediated discussions between the two, said the FAC was considering calling Aussie and Qantas to the table to clarify the spat.
Qantas shares sank in early trade to be down as much as 16c to $2.52 before recovering ground and closing at $2.60, down 8c, with 3.8 million shares traded.
One analyst, who declined to be named, said the fall could be partly attributable to the perceived threat of Mr Grey, but was more likely to be concern over economic problems in Asia and its impact on Qantas&apos; earnings.
Qantas&apos; 1997 annual report indicates that 33 per cent of revenues from 1997 sales were derived from Japan, SouthEast and North-East Asia. Total revenues were $3.94 billion comprising, in part, $583.9 million from Japan and $725 million from South-East and NorthEast Asia.
Qantas has said previously these routes were fairly low-margin business for the airline.
&quot;But any (potential) deterioration in earnings is a negative,&quot; noted the analyst.
A little over a week ago, Qantas chief executive James Strong reaffirmed the airline&apos;s earlier forecast that Qantas would post a modest improvement in its full-year profit result in 1998.
Qantas recorded a net profit of $252.7 million for the year ended June 30, up from $246.2 million the year before.

			<TEXT>THE Federal Airports Corp has stepped up pressure on the Government to privatise Sydney&apos;s four largest airports immediately and speed up the development of a second international airport in the NSW capital.
Managing director Barry Murphy also said the FAC would intervene in the dispute between Qantas and nascent carrier Aussie Airlines if they did not come to an agreement on leasing terminals within a week.
He told the Aviation Press Club in Sydney yesterday that the $3.37 billion privatisation of the Brisbane, Perth and Melbourne airports in the past year had reaped a considerable reward for the Government and had proved that the private sector could play a role in the airport industry.
However, &quot;the sale of the Sydney Basin airports has been held over&quot;, he said, noting that the decision to sell them would be made at the government level - and not by the FAC, which will be wound up by June.
However, Mr Murphy, who came from the private sector before joining the FAC 18 months ago, insisted that the best way to run airports in Australia was privately. He said there was a need to create alliances between federal, State and local airports, and that would be best handled by private enterprise.
Once the existing Sydney airports were sold, their owners - and not the Government - would take on the issue of creating Sydney&apos;s second airport. &quot;The decision on the second major airport in Sydney still eludes us. The new owner should resolve a solution about how to run one airport, (Kingsford Smith at Mascot) or the other, or to run one first. The owner of Sydney&apos;s four airports would be able to maximise the efficiency of who lands where. That would be good for customers.
&quot;By 2003 to 2005, Sydney will come under real pressure in terms of traffic, and an alternative will have to be found.&quot; Mr Murphy also increased the pressure on Qantas and former Compass boss Brian Grey&apos;s Aussie Airlines to find a solution to their differences over terminal leasing.
He said the FAC had noted that Qantas believed Aussie had failed to come up with the $10.5 million to gain a sub-lease over domestic terminals at Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Coolangatta and Adelaide by October 10. The FAC had also noted that Aussie believed it had met the agreement. Both parties are understood to be seeking legal advice.
However, Mr Murphy said that if no solution was found within a week, &quot;we may take another look at the matter&quot;.

			<TEXT>QANTAS will spend $650 million on three new Boeing 747-400 aircraft in the wake of a decision by rival Ansett to defer its decision on new aircraft.
The Qantas order is the first to be placed for 400-passenger Boeing 747 aircraft since 1989, as the airline has sought to strengthen its balance sheet by reducing debt.
And the company is considering a new 300-passenger type, likely to be either a Boeing 777 or Airbus A340, for new services.
Qantas managing director James Strong said yesterday the airline&apos;s strategy also involved improved efficiency. The aircraft would be delivered in 1999 and 2000.

			<TEXT>QANTAS will spend $650 million on three new Boeing 747-400 aircraft to cater for expected growth in passenger numbers and to defend its market position in the longhaul end of the market.
And chief executive James Strong has flagged the development of new routes for the airline.
Mr Strong said Qantas had bought the aircraft after a comprehensive review program and because it believed it would give a &quot;reasonable return on capital&quot;. The aircraft will be delivered in 1999 and 2000.
He also said the airline might change its long-held policy of buying Boeing aircraft, indicating it could consider purchasing Airbus Industrie&apos;s A340 planes.
The purchase of the aircraft was not a departure from Qantas&apos; careful balance-sheet management in the past four years.
&quot;The most ignorant interpretation an observer could make is that Qantas has taken the brakes off,&quot; Mr Strong said.
In the last financial year, cost savings of $563 million enabled Qantas to lift annual profit by 2.6 per cent to $252.7 million.
&quot;This approach will continue in order to maintain our stronger balance sheet position and reduced gearing levels,&quot; Mr Strong said.
At the time, chairman Gary Pemberton predicted only a modest increase in annual profit as business conditions remained tight.
Mr Strong said the purchase of new aircraft did not indicate that Qantas was expecting a sudden upswing in either profit or yield.
But he did say Qantas was anticipating &quot;increases in passenger traffic on current routes&quot;. Since January 1995, Qantas has bought four B737-400 aircraft and four B767-300ER aircraft and will take delivery of two B767-300s next year.
Qantas shares closed 1c higher at $3.16.

			<TEXT>THE Federal Airports Corp has not heard from either Qantas or Bryan Grey&apos;s Aussie Airlines this week in the wake of the new airline missing a deadline to secure subleases at five domestic airports.
Aussie was due to lodge a $10.5 million deposit to Qantas last week to secure the leases, but the deadline passed, with Qantas claiming that all obligations between it and Aussie had now lapsed.
But FAC spokesman Ted Porter said yesterday the corporation was making no decision on the matter until it had heard from both parties.
&quot;Our position is that we are not making any judgments on the situation at the moment and we won&apos;t do that until the facts are presented to us,&quot; Mr Porter said.
Mr Porter said the FAC had held informal talks with Mr Grey over last weekend, but they had not been &quot;of substance&quot;. Mr Grey did not wish to comment on his plans yesterday.
A Qantas spokesman said the airline stuck by its view that the matter was now dead.
Last week, Qantas said: &quot;The agreements provided that if these security deposits or bank guarantees (for the $10.5 million) were not received by that deadline, all obligations of both parties under the sub-leases are terminated.&quot; &quot;The agreements contained a clause in which Aussie Airlines acknowledged that its failure to satisfy the conditions precedent also resulted in it having no further rights to request Qantas to provide sub-leases of domestic terminal facilities,&quot; Qantas said.
The deposit was to go towards rent and refurbishment which Qantas would carry out for Aussie under two year sub-leases signed last month.
Aussie had planned to fly 11 Airbus A300 aircraft between Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, Adelaide and Coolangatta airports.
In early 1995 Aussie requested Qantas to sub-let it space at Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and Coolangatta airports.
Under the FAC leases, Qantas and Ansett are required to negotiate sub-leases with new airlines but Qantas initially refused Aussie&apos;s application and said the company did not constitute a new industry entrant because of its lack of business, capital and a commercial address.
However, the Federal Court threw out Qantas&apos; objections, saying Aussie had standing to apply for use of the terminals.

			<TEXT>THE fifth annual Australian Customer Service Awards, announced at a gala dinner on October 5 in Melbourne, attracted record entries with a 33 per cent increase in applications on the previous year. according to the chairman of the national judging panel, Professor Rob Widing.
More than 500 attended the event, with guest of honour, Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer, praising the winners and emphasising to the attendees the importance of excellent customer service to the export market and trade with overseas visitors.
Managing director of Qantas Airways and Australian Customer Service Association patron, Mr James Strong, took the opportunity during his keynote to invite on stage world champion motorcyclist and a special guest on the night, Michael Doohan.
Doohan discussed the necessity of preparation, training, consistency, dedication and discipline required to win the world title; and how these same qualities are vital in providing good customer service.
Excellence in customer service was particularly recognised in Victoria and Western Australia, with five Victorian companies taking out three national awards and two high commendations; and four Western Australian companies picking up three national awards and a highly commended.
WA-based fertiliser and industrial chemical manufacturer, Wesfarmers CSBP, won the Qantas Outstanding Achievement Award for excellence in customer service as well as a national Customer Service Award.
Other national winners included the Water Corporation of Western Australia and AAMI (large business), Mitchell, Sutton &amp; Gallagher (medium business); and SSL Leisure Services, Mareena Purslowe &amp; Associates, Avis Victoria and Avis North Queensland (division or department).
There were no winners in the small business category this year, due to the applicants all having weaknesses, according to Professor Widing.
&quot;That is a little disappointing,&quot; he said.
&quot;There were state winners (in the small business category) and to be a state winner is an outstanding achievement.
&quot;But in the national category there was not a small business representative. The committee thought long and hard about that ... this is probably just a one-off, in previous years we have given out small business awards.
&quot;Even though small business has undergone a rapid growth phase, in a difficult economic climate, for some time, good customer service must be a fundamental part of their operating philosophy or the prosperity of small business will be undermined,&quot; he said.
Despite the findings of the recent Nett Effect Report on Service Australian Style: Benchmarking Australia&apos;s International Service (the Gold Service 2000 study), commissioned by the Australian Customer Service Association, national president, Tricia Olsen, believes Australia will achieve quality service benchmarks by the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.
&quot;While America is renowned for its `Have a nice day&apos; approach to customer service, Australia has a more informal approach,&quot; Ms Olsen said.
&quot;This is not necessarily a bad thing, as long as our more relaxed approach is supported by a policy that the customer must be supported at every stage of a transaction.&quot;
ACSA introduced the Australian Customer Service Awards in 1992 to recognise the country&apos;s best customer service performers nationally.
T here are four categories - small business or organisation (with a workforce of up to 30 people), medium business or organisation (31-500 people), large organisation (more than 500 people) and division or department within an organisation (with entry fees determined according to staff numbers as above). Applicants must undertake a rigorous audit and evaluation process, involving the lodging of a detailed written submission, which will be assessed on six criteria - service leadership, customer research, employee development, innovation or improvement, responsiveness and customer satisfaction or results.
Shortlisted submissions receive a half-day site visit, where two evaluators (generally senior business people) talk with employees and customers and attempt to match the documented performance against the actual customer service.
State and national finalists are then decided and announced, after which the national judging panel receives the evaluators&apos; comments and decides state and national awards, which are announced at the annual dinner.
This year&apos;s judging panel included Jennifer Neilson (Hallis Personnel), Alan Jones (Optus Communications), John LaVacca (Coopers &amp; Lybrand), Iain Hunter (HMA George Patterson), David Hughes (Qantas) and Paul Byrne (Nett Effect).
Each application is judged on its own merits and not against the performance of other applications in the same category, which means that should more than one entrant be judged to have excelled in all six criteria, more than one award will be given. The reverse applies, as in this year&apos;s small business category.
A written evaluation is given to each applicant, which outlines strengths and suggests areas for improvement and winners are also encouraged to share their awards&apos; experience through study tours and branch presentations.
The Australian Customer Service Association is a non-profit body with some 1500 members which is &quot;dedicated to improving customer service throughout Australia&quot;. It seeks to promote service improvement and the development of service professionals through its activities and programs.
Its highest profile activity is the annual Australian Customer Service Awards.

			<TEXT>PROMINENT Aboriginal activist Michael Mansell was not the most popular person in the world yesterday when 300 passengers bound for Johannesburg on a Qantas flight were delayed for 90 minutes while he staged one of his publicity stunts.
Mansell and two other members of the Aboriginal Provisional Government, Geoff Clark and Glenn Shaw, unsuccessfully tried to show their black, yellow and red Aboriginal &quot;passports&quot; to board the flight.
Melba gathers the trio presented their Australian passports when they checked in at the Qantas desk at Tullamarine, but were stopped when attempting to pass Customs on their Aboriginal documents.
An immigration official says: &quot;If they didn&apos;t want to use their Australian passports to prove their identity, they could have shown their driver&apos;s licence. Officers weren&apos;t preventing them from leaving the country but were just trying to check who they were.&quot;
The trio plans to make another attempt to leave the country today.

			<TEXT>QANTAS and and its alliance partner British Airways are confident of maintaining and even increasing their share of the market with the completion of a $105 million software project. The general manager of the QUBE project (Qantas Universal Business Environment), Lawrie Turner, claimed that at $105 million it could be Australia&apos;s single largest private sector IT software project.
The QUBE project was not a gamble. The system would help Qantas and British Airways capture and hold a significant share of the market well into the next century.
In 1992, the then federal Labor government merged Qantas and Australian Airlines before partial privatisation.
However, the merger created problems. Both airlines had different and incompatible core ticketing/ scheduling and yield management systems.
And so QUBE was born - a software integration project to give the new airline a single system for its essential business operations.
The need for a consistent environment imposed a choice between Qantas&apos; QANTAM ticketing system (built around IBM mainframe code first shipped in 1962) or Australian Airlines&apos; Unisys mainframe-based TAARSAN system (including core code dating back to 1972).
Rather than try to merge the two, Qantas management decided in 1994 to buy a set of systems known as BABS from British Airways which ran on the same core IBM operating software as QANTAM.
Mr Turner said the decision to decommission TAARSAN was difficult, domestic operations being &quot;the more customer-sensitive&quot; of the two sides of Qantas&apos; operations.
&quot;While international travel is the more glamorous, domestic travel is more demanding on the technology.&quot; Transaction loads are greater than in the international environment because many more domestic seats are sold than international. Domestic customers are more sensitive to on-time departure and quick baggage processing.
&quot;Ultimately, the decision to stay with an IBM system was a business one, based on the fact that all of our international partners use the same system,&quot; Mr Turner said.
Staying with the younger Unisys software would have made the task of doing business with those partners much more difficult. It would have been risky, he said.
&quot;The two systems are totally incompatible ... the IBM uses assembler language, Unisys is written in Fortran,&quot; he said.
Another benefit of staying with the system most popular among Qantas business partners was the reduction in training.
Since the system was used by the staff of business partners as well as Qantas&apos; own employees, the training load created by any new system was crucial to the project.
Of the 10,000 people to be trained, 8000 were Qantas front-line staff, 600 corporate, and 1300 users from external companies in over 65 countries.
Of the more than 100 training centres required, Qantas had to build 40. To ensure people could be released from their jobs to train on the new system, Qantas had to hire temporary staff.
Mr Turner said 160 &quot;man-years&quot; of effort were required to make all the changes necessary to the BABS code, with up to 30 British Airways staff working in Sydney with the QUBE team.
QUBE had to change only 10 per cent of the code, but it was a &quot;monster system with millions and millions of lines of code&quot;. &quot;We had software-build work going on in Sydney, Melbourne (in Australian Airlines&apos; computing centre), London, and by a specialist code shop called Norwalk Communications.&quot;
QUBE also demanded a substantial expenditure in upgrading hardware. The airline downturns of the late 1980s and early 1990s had limited Qantas&apos; spending on hardware. It also demanded integration with other systems.
Although airlines had a great number of dumb mainframe terminals in operation, there were too many to replace.
They were everywhere, from Qantas&apos; head office to travel agencies, airlines and airports worldwide.
The systems also had to be available to the newer PC networks installed as access systems were upgraded.
&quot;The entire benefit of QUBE was based on integration with different systems,&quot; Mr Turner said.
For example, since telesales operations were relatively new, users generally accessed the system from PCs. However, integration posed problems.
The computers had to be able to communicate with each other, and the PC interface had to minimise the training needed in an operation of high staff turnover.
The response was QIK (Qantas Intelligent Keyboard), software which took &quot;old-fashioned terminal data&quot; and turned it into &quot;nice friendly PC files&quot;. &quot;So effectively has QIK de-skilled the task of accessing mainframe data from PCs that Qantas has made sales to 25 other airlines,&quot; Mr Turner said.
The greatest risk of the whole QUBE project was the decision to have the entire operation on one system designed for international operations.
Cutover was in two phases - last November and April.
&quot;We had six cutover rehearsals, where we would turn off the old system, turn on the new and test the transactions,&quot; Mr Turner said.
Since reservation bureau work with all airlines, the amount of time available for Qantas to test interfaces was strictly rationed.
Cutover was another immutable deadline.
&quot;Once you&apos;ve set the cutover date on a project this size, to change it would cost millions.&quot;
This made the management of the project crucial to its success.
More than 170 discreet plans and more than 10,000 tasks had to be coordinated.
At the centre of the project management was a software system called PMW (Project Manager Workbench) delivered by Melbourne-based Infact.
Twenty-five PMW licences were bought for the QUBE project office.
In early 1995 new staff were being employed every day.
&quot;In such a volatile environment, PMW helped to ensure that new staff were incorporated into the schedules and assimilated into the project as quickly as possible.&quot;

			<TEXT>BRYAN Grey&apos;s latest attempt to launch a third carrier appeared to be grounded last night after his Aussie Airlines failed to give a $10.5 million security deposit to Qantas.
The deposit was needed to secure sub-leases on airport terminal facilities in Coolangatta, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney.
The deal would have seen the former Compass Airlines chief in his second attempt to create a competing airline to Qantas and Ansett. Mr Grey won a battle in the Federal Court over terminal access but has now surrendered the concessions.

			<TEXT>DON&apos;T be fooled by the &quot;go slow&quot; industrial action from the police force - if reports from Sydney&apos;s police patrols are anything to go by, not much is happening in the criminal world anyway. During her routine round of calls to the various stations yesterday, one colleague was told by a Senior Constable the most exciting thing which had happened during his whole shift was when he dropped a meat pie on his fresh shirt.
*** ANOTHER colleague who phoned the office of Labor Senator Nick Bolkus in Adelaide yesterday was placed on hold. While he waited, the music which had been playing ended and an announcement began: &quot;Remember Keating&apos;s banana republic? Labor did nothing and nor did the Liberals ... the answer is the United Australia Party ...&quot; It might be time to drop whatever local radio station the switchboard is linked to, Senator.
*** IN the middle of a recent flight from Sydney to London, reports one Qantas flight attendant, the night-time quiet was broken by the sound of a passenger call button. Responding, the woman was greeted by a gent whose hunger hadn&apos;t quite been sated by the in-flight meal. &quot;Can I have a hamburger and a milkshake, please?&quot; he asked. &quot;I&apos;m sorry, sir,&quot; came the reply, &quot;but this is a 747, not a 7-Eleven.&quot;
*** SPOTTED in a northern newspaper this week was an ad from someone looking for a home for their two dogs. &quot;Heinz Variety&quot;, the ad stated. Intrigued as to just what a Heinz Variety dog was, one reader phoned the number and was given the following logical explanation: &quot;They&apos;ve got so many different breeds in them, we reckon there&apos;s about 57 different varieties, you know, like the Heinz ads ...&quot;
*** LISTED under &quot;Traveller&apos;s Information&quot; in a local magazine this week, reports one Balmain reader, was just one piece of information: &quot;Sydney&apos;s fun in summer&quot;. Not very informative, but as we all know it&apos;s perfectly true!

			<TEXT>AUSSIE Airlines is due to hand over a $10.5 million deposit to Qantas today to secure sub-leases at five local airports but Aussie chief Bryan Grey yesterday refused to confirm whether his company would meet the deadline set last month.
Mr Grey has previously claimed his new airline venture would be backed by overseas investors but has also said the protracted negotiations with Qantas and the Federal Airports Corp to secure space at domestic airport terminals may have deterred investors.
The deposit, due by 5pm today, represents a payment towards rent and refurbishment Qantas will carry out for Aussie under the two year subleases, signed last month.
Aussie Airlines plans to fly 11 Airbus A300 aircraft between Melbourne, Sydney, Coolangatta, Brisbane, Cairns, Adelaide, Hobart and Perth, from March next year.
In early 1995, Aussie requested Qantas to sub-let space at Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, Adelaide and Coolangatta airports.
Under the FAC leases, Qantas and Ansett are required to negotiate sub-leases with new airlines but Qantas initially refused Aussie&apos;s application and said the company did not constitute a new industry entrant because of its lack of business, capital, and a commercial address.
In June last year, the Federal Court ruled Aussie had standing to apply for the use of the terminals.
Late last year, the FAC served a breach of lease notice on Qantas which threatened to evict the airline from the FAC terminals, before Qantas eventually began negotiations with Aussie in December.
The FAC set an original deadline of February 28 this year for sub-leases to be signed but the talks have been protracted and an agreement was signed only last month.
Mr Grey launched Compass Airlines in 1990 but the company collapsed at Christmas 1991. A second incarnation of Compass, which Mr Grey was not associated with, also failed.
While Mr Grey is the visible face of Aussie and is likely to be chairman of the new airline, his equity stake and management role will probably be minor.
In the most recent edition of his Aviation Analyst newsletter, Peter Harbison said several factors would favour a start-up airline such as Aussie.
He said domestic airfares provided adequate yields for new entrants; the price of used aircraft was dropping as airlines upgraded their fleets, and marketing and distribution was more flexible with means such as the Internet.
He also cited the success of operations such as Freedom Air, the low-cost subsidiary of Air New Zealand. However, he also warned that Qantas and Ansett - the latter backed by Air NZ and Singapore Airlines - would be well-placed to fight any newcomer, and retain a strong hold on distribution networks within Australia, particularly travel agents.
&quot;In the past, necessary ingredients for a start-up airline appeared to be a large ego and the ability to dream,&quot; Mr Harbison said.
&quot;However, the meagre returns of even successful airlines have made it increasingly difficult to attract institutional and private investors to new operations ... there will have to be a much sharper cutting edge this time around if the airline is to get off the ground.&quot;

			<TEXT>AN increase in birdstrikes at Sydney Airport has been linked to rising numbers of a protected species of large bird attracted to a nearby garbage dump.
The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation and Qantas believe an ibis disabled a Qantas jet when it was sucked into an engine of a Boeing 737. The birdstrike on September 10 set one of the 737&apos;s two engines ablaze.
Witnesses said the cabin of the aircraft - containing 106 passengers and crew - filled with smoke and the pilot was forced to turn back and land.
A spokesman for Qantas said yesterday the airline was &quot;concerned&quot; about the risk of birdstrikes from ibises.
&quot;We have been monitoring the situation. We are concerned at the build-up in bird numbers - in particular the ibises - in the area around the airport,&quot; the spokesman said.
A source at Sydney Airport told The Daily Telegraph there was concern that increasing numbers of ibises were being attracted to the airport area by the Tempe waste transfer station, about 3km north of Mascot.
The airport source said large birds, including ibises, could &quot;destroy&quot; a jet engine and it was &quot;ridiculous to have this kind a facility anywhere near an airport&quot;. A National Parks and Wildlife Service spokeswoman said yesterday there had been &quot;reports of more birds in the Tempe area&quot;. &quot;They are scavengers and they tend to hang around tips,&quot; she said.
According to the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, there were 101 birdstrikes at Sydney Airport - five of which caused minor damage - in 1996.
This compares with 74 birdstrikes in 1995, 79 in 1994 and and 37 in 1993.
A spokesman for the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation said he believed it was an ibis that was sucked into the Qantas 737&apos;s engine but it was not known &quot;where the ibis had taken up residence&quot;. &quot;That is a matter for the Federal Airports Corporation,&quot; he said.
The NPWS spokeswoman said: &quot;If the FAC think they are a problem then they can apply to us for a licence and we will look into it.
&quot;If we decide they pose a threat to public health or safety we will issue a licence to have them relocated or killed.&quot;
But an FAC spokesman said the corporation already &quot;has a bird strategy&quot;. &quot;We have a range of bird deterrent programs including bird harassment,&quot; he said.
The spokesman said the devices included &quot;crackers&quot; to scare the birds away.
&quot;These birds are a Sydney-wide phenomenon,&quot; the spokesman said.
The Qantas spokesman said he believed the build-up of Ibises was &quot;apparently because of favourable weather&quot;. &quot;The airline has approached both the FAC and BASI to see if we can get a co-ordinated approach to the problem,&quot; he said.
A spokeswoman for Sydney City Council said a meeting was held with the FAC last year.
&quot;They were happy with council&apos;s policy. They do not believe there is any potential for danger,&quot; she said.
&quot;There was a situation a couple of weeks ago where bird hit a plane but no one spoke to us about it.
&quot;Also this tip does not accept putrescent garbage, so there is no food for the birds to eat.&quot;
Risk grows
o Bureau of Air Safety Investigation figures revealed there were 101 birdstrikes at Sydney Airport - five of which caused minor damage - in 1996.
o There were 74 birdstrikes in 1995, 79 in 1994 and 37 in 1993.
o An ibis is believed to be the bird sucked into a Qantas 737&apos;s engine last month.

			<TEXT>POLITICIANS with one eye on the ballot box have ensured a bonanza for investors in State and federal privatisations to date.
The 1990s have been marked by a steady flow of former government institutions joining the Australian Stock Exchange trading boards.
All are now trading ahead of their issue price.
West Australian insurer SGIO, NSW insurer GIO and Qantas all fell below their issue price shortly after floating, but have since recovered strongly in line with the wider market.
Among the best performers have been Victoria&apos;s Tabcorp and the former Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (renamed CSL), which listed in May 1994 and is now trading at four times its $2.30 issue price.
All investors who poured into the Commonwealth Bank sold in three tranches between August 1991 and July last year - are in the money as the stock continues to trade near record highs.
The stock, which was originally issued to the public at $5.40 a share, finished at $17.11 yesterday.
The second parcel of 20 per cent of the bank was issued at $9.35 a share to retail investors and $9.60 to institutions furious about the modest discount for the so-called &quot;mums and dads&quot; investors.
However, all investors who subscribed for shares as part of the November 1993 issue were quickly out of the money as the stock sank below its issue price before recovering.
The last tranche of shares went to investors at an effective price of $10.45 in two instalments.
Cynics and critics have suggested the State and federal governments are undervaluing privatised assets in order to generate sound returns for investors and ultimately keep voters happy.
Telstra alone is expected to attract up to 2 million shareholders, with the three tranches of CBA shares wooing a total of 470,000 investors - or voters.
Australian Democrats leader Cheryl Kernot said yesterday the $12 billion-$14.2 billion valuation range for Telstra undervalued the giant carrier by up to $5 billion.
She also claimed share price rises by CSL, Qantas and CBA after share market listings had robbed taxpayers of hundreds of millions of dollars and indicated the &quot;Australian public was being ripped off&quot;. &quot;A successful float is one where the Australian taxpayers get the proper value for their sale of a public asset, not one where only the stock market players profit,&quot; she said.

			<TEXT>ADVERTISING jingles over loudspeakers and full-page advertisements in the official program for the opening of NSW Parliament demeaned the event, MPs said yesterday.
Upper House MP Franca Arena called the advertising the &quot;commercialisation of Parliament&apos; and said she felt it was &quot;demeaning [to] us all as Members of Parliament&quot;. Qantas was offered the free advertising after providing a giant video screen and commmentary for yesterday&apos;s lavish ceremony.
Action from inside the Upper and Lower Houses of Parliament was beamed on to the screen - even though it faced towards Parliament House so no-one in the crowd could see it.
The national carrier&apos;s jingle was played over loudspeakers before the arrival of dignitaries and their logo appeared on the first and last pages of the program.
However, while the exclusive advertising offer to Qantas upset some MPs, others took it as a show of Parliamentary President Max Willis&apos;s special relationship with the airline.
&quot;I assumed it meant that Mr Willis had generously paid for the whole extravaganza by utilising some of his frequent flyer points,&quot; Fair Trading Minister Faye Lo Po&apos; said.

			<TEXT>TRADITIONAL pomp and ceremony marched hand in hand with crass commercialism in a bizarre and acrimonious formal re-opening of the NSW parliament by Governor Gordon Samuels in Sydney yesterday.
As the politicians sledged wasting some $30,000 of taxpayers&apos; money on a pointless mid-term extravagance, Qantas created an Australian first by becoming official sponsor for the day&apos;s events.
For its $10,000 sling Qantas had signage rights on the official parliamentary program and permission to set up a giant screen in Macquarie Street from which to televise the elaborate proceedings.
And elaborate they were.
Qantas and the thousand or so punters who gathered in Macquarie Street were treated to all the ceremonial goodies from police bands and a 19-gun salute to a chorus line of red-caped judges and a military guard of honour.
The sponsorship deal was the brainchild of the Liberal Upper House president Max Willis, who wanted to defray costs and, perhaps admirably, take the glory of parliament to the people.
But the initiative failed to win Premier Bob Carr, who said Mr Willis needed a &quot;reality check&quot; for turning the nation&apos;s oldest parliament into a circus and a monument to government waste.
Mr Willis - resplendent in buckled boots, wig and lace collar - hit back, accusing Mr Carr of hypocrisy and defying him to order the ceremonial opening cancelled.
&quot;It is Premier Carr&apos;s perogative whether or not the Governor opens parliament ... all the parliament does is stage the ceremony as it has been staged for 150 years,&quot; Mr Willis said.
As the hostilities grew Opposition Leader Peter Collins wasn&apos;t going to miss out.
He said it was &quot;just crazy to bung on the full bells and whistles&quot; halfway through a four-year parliamentary term.
&quot;Bob Carr called this on and it is a circus which should never have happened,&quot; Mr Collins boomed.
Protesters, some dressed as clowns and carrying placards which read &quot;Civic rights, not circus rites&quot; added to the barnyard flavour.
At one stage a small group took up the protesters&apos; anthem: What do we want? &quot;Less money spent on this crap! &apos;
It was a sentiment shared by many.
Ironically, the protesters were strangely subdued when a mounted police escort produced Governor Samuels, who was presiding over his first official parliamentary opening.
A down-to-earth chap by vice regal standards, the governor restored an air of dignity to the proceedings when he stopped for a chat with some onlookers.

			<TEXT>FOR the third successive summer, Antarctica will this year be the destination for holidaymakers visiting from above.
The sights of the remote frozen continent are to be enjoyed once again from the comfort of a 747-400.
The chartered Qantas jet will wing its way south this season for a series of 10 flights starting on November 30.
The flights, conducted by Croydon Travel, have become as popular with international tourists as Australians, said Croydon Travel&apos;s managing director Phil Lasker.
&quot;Antarctica is the world&apos;s last great wilderness area ... it has been identified by tourism researchers as a major destination of the future.
&quot;What we are offering today is a preview of Antarctica for those who believe travel is all about new experiences.&quot;
Flying at 10,000 feet and 28 per cent throttle, passengers are treated to grandstand views of the Antarctic coastline and interior.
Although routes vary, a typical flight takes in the coastline from Cape Adare, south to the Ross Ice Shelf before turning west to the French base of Dumont d&apos;Urville and back to Australia via the South Magnetic Pole - around 12 hours from take-off to landing.
A video camera on the flight deck is relayed into the cabin for a pilot&apos;s eye view and Australian bases make cheerio calls as the plane flies overhead.
It&apos;s Antarctic exploration without the discomfort that confronted Mawson, Scott and Amundsen - passengers are back home the same night.
Prices vary by seating for the flights.
An economy-class centre seat begins at $799, premium economy seats $1599 and first class are a cool $3199.
The overnight New Year&apos;s Eve flight - complete with onboard jazz band - is an extra $200.
Flights leave Sydney, Melbourne and Perth from November 30 to February 15.
Launching the summer season flights, Environment Minister Robert Hill said: &quot;Research in atmospheric science, glaciology and ocean sciences, are all vitally important, and one that we haven&apos;t done quite as much from an Australian perspective.
&quot;But hopefully we might do more in the future because we are a world leader.&quot;

			<TEXT>THE Civil Aviation Safety Authority is likely to release its decision on the Airspace 2000 plan within days, after a public comment period which drew criticism of the plan from Qantas.
The airline said any move from Class C to Class E airspace should be backed by the installation of radar in some locations as a &quot;mitigating safety factor&quot;, and said without radar the changes would be &quot;unacceptable&quot;. Qantas is believed to be concerned about the ability of Visual Flight Rules aircraft to use airspace near areas such as Alice Springs, without being separated from larger aircraft by air traffic controllers.
Airservices chief executive Bill Pollard has already said the authority was considering the installation of radar at Alice Springs in response to industry requests.
At a press conference last month, Mr Pollard said radar at Alice Springs would cost between $6 million and $8 million, compared with estimated annual savings from Airspace 2000 of $20 million.
Airservices hopes to introduce the first part of Airspace 2000, including the move to Class E airspace, from December 4.
But the plan still requires final approval from CASA, including the CASA board, with a decision expected today. One of the architects of Airspace 2000, Dick Smith, is now deputy chairman of CASA and is likely to take part in any debate over the plan.
Groups representing Qantas and Ansett pilots have already threatened to boycott airports without radar coverage at Launceston, Hobart, Alice Springs and Port Hedland, where airspace will shift from Class C to Class E.
Air traffic controllers and flight service officers have also opposed parts of the plan on safety concerns, although none has rejected Airspace 2000 outright.
The plan has won support from Airservices&apos; management and some parts of the aviation community, including the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association representing pilots of light aircraft.
Last month, Mr Pollard called the new plan a &quot;cultural change&quot; which &quot;places more responsibility on pilots&quot; to avoid other aircraft and move from a system of air traffic control to air traffic management.
He also rejected claims by pilots that the plan could increase the risk of mid-air collisions between aircraft.
If CASA does not approve the Airspace 2000 plan, any proposals to redraw Australian airspace are likely to be shelved for at least 18 months until after the introduction of TAAATS (The Advanced Australian Air Traffic System) next year.
CASA is still calling for public and industry comment on another change planned under Airspace 2000, the removal of directed traffic information in Class G airspace over large areas of central Australia.
Those changes are not due to come into effect until February 4, with a final decision from CASA due later this month.

			<TEXT>A QANTAS jet made an emergency landing at Sydney Airport yesterday after a bird flew into one of its engines and caused a small fire.
An airline spokesman said the Boeing 737 bound for Auckland took off at 7.35am and hit the bird shortly after as it headed north over Sydney.
&quot;The captain shut down the engine and returned to Sydney Airport where engineers are inspecting the damaged engine,&quot; he said.
The spokesman said the bird could have damaged the fan blades inside one of the plane&apos;s two engines, causing it to malfunction.

			<TEXT>A QANTAS Boeing 737 bound for New Zealand was forced to return to Sydney today after it struck a bird on take off.
The pilot was forced to shut down one engine of the twin-engined jet, carrying 98 people.
A Qantas spokeswoman said nobody was injured in the drama, and said the incident had been treated as routine procedure.
She said reports from people under the flightpath that the engine had caught fire were incorrect.
Engineers were today checking the engine for any damage.

			<TEXT>QANTAS flight attendants must shave, the Industrial Relations Commission ruled yesterday.
The Flight Attendants&apos; Association argued the airline was overreacting to safety concerns and interfering with workers&apos; rights by insisting they shave.
But Commissioner Frank Palmer ruled that not even stubble should be allowed because it could stop oxygen masks working in an emergency. He said the dispute was a safety issue, &quot;not one going to grooming or presentation standards&quot;. Ansett Australia has also been involved in a dispute with its male pilots and flight attendants over facial hair.
It issued a notice to all staff that facial hair was banned.

			<TEXT>QANTAS Airways is one of four parties being sued by the Airport Commission of San Francisco for costs to clean up environmental damage it claims was created by their operations.
The commission said the US airport had already incurred more than $7 million in cleanup costs and has launched legal action to recover damages and costs to &quot;remove contamination and conditions of nuisance caused by these companies&quot;. The parties alleged to have caused the damage include Qantas, Avis Rent-a-Car System, Atlantic Richfield Co and Unocal Corporation.
&quot;During construction of the Airport&apos;s Master Plan Projects, the Airport has identified soil and ground water contamination on the sites currently or formerly occupied by the companies,&quot; said airport director John Martin.
&quot;Some of these tenants operated here for more than 25 years and have a contractual obligation to clean up and remove contamination caused by their operations.
Qantas spokesman Bernard Shirley said the airline wrote to the commission seeking further information about the nature of the complaints.
He said Qantas had not operated out of San Francisco Airport for more than 10 years.
Meanwhile Qantas Airways chief executive James Strong has poured doubt on the prospect of a third airline in Australia becoming successful.

&quot;These tenants have not honoured their contractual obligations and through this action we intend to cover costs.&quot; Qantas spokesman Bernard Shirley said the airline wrote to the commission seeking further information about the nature of the complaints.
He said Qantas had not operated out of San Francisco Airport for more than 10 years, but had been a tenant of hangar facilities at the airport between 1962 and 1986.
Meanwhile Qantas Airways chief executive James Strong yesterday poured doubt on the prospect of a third airline in Australia becoming a successful proposition.
&quot;Recently there have been about three other potential start-ups who have all fallen over before they have got to the gate - so certainly the prospects would not be very promising,&quot; Mr Strong told Nine Network&apos;s Business Sunday program. Mr Strong said an initial issue in the success of potential competitors such as Bryan Grey&apos;s Aussie Airline which plans to enter the domestic market in the first half of 1998, was the requirement of a capital payment to secure terminal leases.
He said investors should carefully consider the long term viability fo such ventures before getting involved.
Negotiations between Qantas and Aussie were continuing over access to terminals.
&quot;I think there are something like 70 items still under discussion because we are talking about very detailed arrangements at all of the major terminals around Australia,&quot; Mr Strong said.
Mr Strong last week announced a 2.6 per cent improved net profit of $252.7 million for 1996/97.

			<TEXT>QANTAS expects to reach agreement for terminal access with Bryan Grey&apos;s would-be Aussie Airlines by the end of the month but has questioned the financial viability of a third carrier in the local market.
Qantas chief executive James Strong said yesterday Qantas was working towards the Federal Airport Corp&apos;s deadline of reaching agreement on terminal leases by the end of the month.
However, he said an agreement was only &quot;stage one&quot;, with Aussie then required to deliver an upfront payment to secure the leases.
&quot;The question is, is the money available, and that&apos;s something which I don&apos;t know about,&quot; Mr Strong told the Nine Network&apos;s Business Sunday program.
Aussie, which hopes to compete with Qantas and Ansett in the domestic market, still requires funding and aircraft but insists both are available from overseas sources.
Mr Strong said it was unlikely another airline would be &quot;viable for any period of time&quot;. &quot;I think obviously that&apos;s something that anyone who&apos;s being asked to invest would have to evaluate very, very carefully,&quot; he said.
Several start-up airlines have failed in recent years, including Compass in Australia and Kiwi Air in New Zealand.
Mr Strong said conditions were tight in the domestic aviation industry, with Qantas not expecting strong growth this year after last week posting a modest 2.6 per cent rise in 1996-97 net profit.

			<TEXT>QANTAS Airways, delivering on its promise to achieve substantial cost savings, has reported a 2.6 per cent higher annual profit despite difficult trading conditions.
The carrier overcame competitive pressures and higher fuel prices to earn $252.7 million in the June year compared with a $246.7 million net profit the year before.
Managing director James Strong said the market place was tougher than predicted.
But cost savings of $563.8 million enabled modest profit growth.
&quot;We achieved significant progress in the year, with our cost containment right across the board,&quot; Mr Strong said.
&quot;That was vital to improving our profit because of enormous pressure on yield.
&quot;The cost cutting will continue into next year.&quot; Qantas had budgeted for cost savings totalling $430 million in 1996-97.
Chairman Gary Pemberton, saying conditions would remain tough, yesterday predicted the airline would record a slight improvement in operating profit this year.
&quot;We expect demand in the domestic economy will remain soft, putting pressure on yields and volumes in both our international and domestic operations,&quot; he said.
&quot;Whilst results for July have been in line with expectations, we are still cautious about the prospects for the 1997-98 financial year.&quot; The past year&apos;s sales revenue was 3.1 per cent higher at $7.83 billion.
Shareholders will get a final, fully franked dividend of 6.5c a share against 6.5c previously, making a steady annual payout of 13c partly franked.
Investors reacted positively to the result, driving the shares 5c higher to $3.06.
The result included a $17.2 million abnormal loss, involving a $99.4 million profit from the sale of the group&apos;s Air New Zealand stake, a $60 million loss in staff redundancy costs and $56.6 million write-off of international aircraft incabin assets.
Domestic operations contributed $168.3 million in earnings before interest and tax, which was 2.9 per cent better than the previous year, while international operations were 2.6 per cent higher at $274.7 million.
Passenger yield fell 6 per cent, but revenue growth was achieved through marketing campaigns which resulted in an 8.6 per cent increase in international passenger numbers.
The company said it was focusing heavily on improving yield.

The company said it was focussing heavily on improving its yield position.
The airline&apos;s revenue from Japan, once one of its strongest performers took a substantial slide from $742.1 million to $583.9 million.
Mr Strong said the revenue had been affected by the movements of the currency and price pressures.
&quot;Japan was a disproportionately large contributor to Qantas profit in late &apos;80s and early &apos;90s, but that super profit is gone and will not return,&quot; Mr Strong said.
The UK and Europe improved 2.4 per cent to $723.1 million while South East Asia and North East Asia contributed $725 million in revenue from $693.6 million.
He said the company was focusing on increasing its capacity in China and India which were more profitable routes than other parts of Asia.

			<TEXT>IF the yet-to-emerge bid by Barrick Gold for Joe Gutnick&apos;s Great Central Mines is the most anticipated deal in the market, Normandy Mining&apos;s actual move on to the register must be one of the least.
Only last week Normandy scotched rumours that it was doing due diligence on GCM.
&quot;Of course, GCM&apos;s Jundee and Bronzewing are very, very attractive assets - anyone would like to have them,&quot; Normandy&apos;s executive general manager, corporate affairs, Colin Jackson told a Capitalist.
He said Normandy was not looking for a takeover of that size and that dozens of projects were competing internally for funds.
The market was surprised, then, to learn Robert Champion De Crespigny&apos;s major miner had picked up a 10 per cent stake in GCM, with the chance of going to 25 per cent by lending Joe $155 million to fund onmarket bids for fellow Yandal Belters Eagle Mining and Wiluna Mines.
The Normandy news, in a statement to the ASX at the open of trade, was all the more surprising given de Crespigny had just spent a few hours over eggs benedict at a Securities Institute brekky in Sydney briefing bankers, analysts and the media on the miner&apos;s profit results, released on Wednesday.
Then again, perhaps the signs were there as de Crespigny outlined his aim to lift earnings 10 per cent and lauded the value in Australian gold assets at the moment.
He is not in the habit of being a minority shareholder so it&apos;s anyone&apos;s guess how long he&apos;ll stick around with less than a controlling interest.
Of course, if Normandy takes shares as repayment of the bid finance, it will become the largest shareholder in Great Central and a big wheel in the Yandal Belt.
Gutnick&apos;s private holding company, Edensor Nominees, which holds 20 per cent of GCM, will be diluted to 17 per cent in this deal.
Joe is not ruling out the bid from Barrick emerging - he&apos;s off to Toronto next week.But we&apos;re getting ahead of ourselves. Bell Securities has the job of standing in the market for GCM in both bids and as of yesterday it had less than 1 per cent of Wiluna and no Eagle shares. o
o o IN an era of continuous disclosure, companies are obviously becoming more effective at massaging, or perhaps managing, market expectations.
Tabcorp&apos;s $100.8 million 1996-97 net profit lobbed in the middle of analysts&apos; forecast range published in The Estimates Directory - no mean feat when the range stretches just 4 per cent from Merrill Lynch&apos;s $98.9 million to SBC Warburg&apos;s $103 million. Most were around $101 million, with Daiwa hitting the mark with a call of $100.8 million made in March.
Not bad considering Tabcorp&apos;s chief bookmaker, Ross Wilson, says trading in the second half was slightly ahead of budget.
Tabcorp is not alone, of course. Only last week, Prime Television gave some clues on its likely performance.
Noting market forecasts of $15.5 million to $16 million - directors said that &quot;at this time, subject to finalisation and audit of the accounts, they expect the profit to be at the top of that range&quot;.
o o o QANTAS usually attracts a protestor at every annual meeting and a posse of cameras at every press conference - the No Aircraft Noise Party, and last year the Save Albert Park-ers protesting against the Victorian Grand Prix, sponsored by the flying kangaroo.
But with no recent controversies to speak of - no retrenchments of engineering apprentices, no chocolate sauce food poisoning - the boardroom for yesterday&apos;s 1996-97 results briefing was surprisingly spacious and almost TV-free.
So roomy, in fact, that chairman Gary Pemberton quipped that the better the Qantas result, the less media were interested.
Managing director James Strong was keen to emphasise that Qantas was not &quot;cost cutting&quot;; instead, it is now engaged in a program of &quot;cost containment&quot;. &quot;Cost cutting&quot; has unsavoury connotations for an airline which prides itself as the world&apos;s safest.
o o o OPPOSITION Leader Kim Beazley was not in the best of health yesterday but his wit was fine.
Addressing the Australia-Israeli Chamber of Commerce lunch he croaked that he wanted John Howard&apos;s job but all he had inherited so far was his disease.
Although it was only flu, and not pneumonia, Mr Beazley said if he was unable to complete his address one of the many luminaries in the audience - among them &quot;our beloved former leader&quot; Bob Hawke - could always finish it for him, with integrity, &quot;then abuse hell out of me afterwards&quot;.

			<TEXT>QANTAS is becoming one of the world&apos;s most conservative airlines not a bad thing in an industry known for its volatility but not necessarily a great long-term trend for a sector experiencing little growth in a low inflation world.
Qantas is super-sensitive about suggestions the airline is in any way shrinking.
It has recorded a 30 per cent increase in passenger numbers over the past three years as well as a 25 per cent increase in capacity and 12 per cent increase in staff numbers.
But maintaining profit growth is becoming harder.
Qantas&apos; 2.6 per cent increase in full year net profit to $252.7 million for 1996-97, announced yesterday, was achieved only with substantial cost reductions and productivity improvements.
Had the airline maintained the status quo on costs, it would still have returned a profit but probably not the growth.
To quote Qantas managing director James Strong, investors and airlines must realise that the &quot;worm line of yield is not suddenly going to have a steroid dose and shoot upwards&quot;. The concern for Qantas, and shareholders, is whether the airline can rely on &quot;tweaking&quot; costs and productivity for profit growth - a phrase chairman Gary Pemberton used last year but not yesterday.
Asked yesterday to name the geographical areas that offer the best opportunities for Qantas, Mr Strong listed India, Indonesia and China.
However, he said: &quot;There are plenty of growth opportunities around but the big issue for us is that to take advantage of that opportunity, you must have an outlook that you will get a reasonable return in terms of profit ... and we have to be selective about which growth opportunities we invest in.&quot; For the 1997-98 year, Qantas is hoping for a &quot;small improvement&quot; on yesterday&apos;s figure.
With Qantas expecting fuel prices to remain high and yields to remain low, any improvement is likely to come from cost reductions and better yield management through its new $100 million QUBE system.
The other hope for improved profits is the airline&apos;s $550 million refit program.
Squeezing big gains out of those three measures will be difficult.
The QUBE system&apos;s benefits are only just starting to kick in and Mr Strong agreed that finding cost reductions of the magnitude of previous years - up to $500 million will be hard.
As for the refit program, it is yet to be seen whether new seats and services will put Qantas ahead of the competition and bring in more revenue or simply enable it to maintain its position.
The biggest part of the refit program, the installation of inflight entertainment systems including interactive videos, is also the most problematic.
Qantas cites problems which other airlines have experienced with IFE systems, such as unreliability, costs and the weight and heat generated.
Still, Singapore Airlines and others now claim to have their IFE systems &quot;largely right&quot; so the longer Qantas takes to install and promote interactive entertainment the greater the risk it will have to spend $350 million just to catch up.
Buying new aircraft is another area where Qantas remains conservative. But Mr Strong is no romantic when it comes to buying new planes.
&quot;They are shiny and lovely, and we all love the sight of them, but the thing we have to keep saying is you only buy aircraft when you have a reasonable expectation of making a good return on them,&quot; he said.
&quot;Investment in aircraft will be driven by the future profitability attached to that investment more than it will be by the balance sheet.&quot; In other words, no big buying sprees at Boeing or Airbus in the near future.
Increasingly, aircraft have to justify their place in the Qantas fleet before rolling off the production line and new routes have to pay their way almost immediately.
Such a conservative philosophy will do good things in the short term for the balance sheet but it is hard to see potential for substantial profit growth in the longer term.
Of course, it is easier to find growth opportunities at a poor-performing airline like Ansett. The lower a result, the more scope for improvement and Ansett will win much acclaim when it simply goes back into the black.
Qantas is a different animal - a large international airline where making profits is not enough. It must also satisfy shareholders looking not only for dividends but dividend and share price growth, and that task is becoming increasingly tough.

			<TEXT>QANTAS has defied rising fuel prices and lower yields to deliver a 2.6 per cent increase in net profit for 1996-97, but yesterday warned of a subdued outlook for the current year.
Chairman Gary Pemberton said the airline was still hopeful of delivering a &quot;small&quot; profit increase in 1997-98, compared with yesterday&apos;s net profit of $252.7 million.
But he said Qantas expected local demand to remain soft, putting pressure on both international and domestic operations.
&quot;Revenue growth is likely to be modest and fuel prices are anticipated to remain relatively high,&quot; he said.
Managing director James Strong said the 1996-97 profit growth was largely due to continued cost reductions of $563 million, in all divisions.
But contrary to the half-year and last year&apos;s results, when Qantas publicly proclaimed cost-cutting targets, Mr Strong yesterday declined to put a figure on the target for 1997-98.
While total revenue increased by 7.2 per cent to $8.3 billion, and operating profit before tax and abnormal items was up 4.8 per cent to $420.9 million, the net result was reduced by abnormal writedowns from Qantas&apos; $550 million inflight investment program and $60 million in staff redundancy costs.
Net abnormal losses were $17.2 million, reduced by an abnormal gain of $99.4 million from the sale of a 19.9 per cent stake in Air New Zealand earlier this year.
Total passenger numbers rose 6.4 per cent and passenger revenue grew by 1.8 per cent, but the yield per passenger dropped 6 per cent, reflecting fierce price competition, particularly on international routes.
Qantas&apos; domestic airline earnings before interest and tax rose 2.9 per cent to $168.3 million, while the international airline&apos;s EBIT increased 2.6 per cent to $272.7 million.
Profit increases on European, Asian and US/Pacific routes were partly offset by the ongoing problem markets of Japan and New Zealand, which recorded losses.
Capital expenditure, largely on airport terminal developments and four new Boeing aircraft, rose 21.3 per cent to $610 million. Qantas plans to add two more Boeing 767-300 aircraft to its fleet this year.
Qantas&apos; full-year dividend remains unchanged at 13c for the full year, fully franked, after a 6.5c a share dividend for the second half.
Mr Strong said Qantas had held discussions with the Fijian Government about the Government&apos;s plans to sell down its stake in national carrier Air Pacific. Qantas holds a 17.5 per cent stake in Air Pacific and codeshares with the airline on routes to Fiji. Mr Strong yesterday said Qantas was &quot;interested&quot; in the government sale but had not decided whether to raise its holding.
Qantas shares yesterday rose 5c to close at $3.06. TABLE AVAILABLE - AT A GLANCE.

			<TEXT>THE full-year results for Qantas and Ansett, due for release this week, will once again emphasise the yawning chasm in financial performance between the airlines once thought to be equals.
The reality for Ansett is that it is a vastly different business in size, structure and performance to the bigger and stronger Qantas, a story that executive chairman Rod Eddington has been telling staff for some months now.
Ansett&apos;s financial position for the 1996-97 year is already public, in approximate figures anyway - the airline has recorded an operating loss of about $3 million, with a better performance by domestic and regional operations dragged down by losses of around $53 million from Ansett International.
This week&apos;s result for The News Corporation Ltd - expected on Wednesday - will contain some reference to Ansett&apos;s performance, but whether it is the same figure revealed by Mr Eddington in July is uncertain. Different accounting methods used by News, Ansett and the airline&apos;s other parent, Air New Zealand, mean three different numbers could be circulating for the same year.
Last year News listed Ansett as recording an operating loss of about $6 million while TNT, then the airline&apos;s other 50 per cent owner, said the airline recorded a &quot;small profit&quot;. Ansett&apos;s real position will be clearer when the airline releases its annual report, in late September after Air NZ announces its 1996-97 result.
Meanwhile, the numbers for Qantas will be easier to interpret when the airline releases its result on Thursday, but analysts are having a tougher time predicting whether Qantas will be able to beat last year&apos;s net profit of $246 million.
At half-year the market was surprised by a net profit of $151.4 million, but the second half is traditionally slower for airlines. Analysts&apos; forecasts now range between a net profit of $230 million and $265 million for the full year. If Qantas can squeeze a higher profit out of a lowgrowth industry, it will come from the airline&apos;s wideranging review which aimed to cut operating costs by at least $430 million in the 1996-97 year.
An abnormal pre-tax gain of $99 million, resulting from the sale of a 19.4 per cent stake in Air NZ sold by Qantas in March, may boost the result.
But some analysts now expect the abnormal writedowns from Qantas&apos; new $550 million aircraft fitout program will balance the Air NZ gain. The sale generated total proceeds of $380 million, which managing director James Strong said would be used to reduce Qantas&apos; gearing.
The first half of 1996-97 included $50 million in extra costs from higher jet fuel prices, and a virtual collapse in the once-lucrative Japanese market.
Yet the airline still managed to deliver an interim profit rise and in its favour for the full year, jet fuel prices have stabilised and many other international routes are turning a profit, or at least paying their way.
Even if Qantas cannot deliver a higher profit than last year, it will not necessarily herald a freefall in the airline&apos;s share price, which closed 5c higher at $3.03 on Friday.
The market will be more interested in how the result has been achieved, than the actual number. A profit based on lower operating costs is more likely to be repeated next year, and that sort of stability is valued in the aviation sector where volatility is the norm.

			<TEXT>PILOTS from Qantas, Ansett and regional airlines have joined air traffic controllers to oppose a new air-space plan which they say will increase the risk of mid-air collisions between aircraft.
Airservices Australia hopes to introduce the Airspace 2000 plan in early December, but the three industry groups said yesterday the plan will &quot;significantly reduce air safety&quot;. They claimed the risk of collisions would increase by allowing light aircraft to share airspace with larger, commercial aircraft without being separated by air traffic controllers in some regions.
Instead, the smaller aircraft, known as Visual Flight Rules aircraft, will be responsible to avoid collisions under a &quot;see and be seen&quot; rule.
A joint statement by the Ansett Airlines Pilots&apos; Association, the Australian Federation of Air Pilots and the air traffic controllers&apos; union, Civil Air, follows a statement by the Australian and International Pilots Association on Thursday, representing Qantas pilots, which also condemned the plan.
The four organisations claimed aircraft in the Hobart, Launceston, Alice Springs and Port Hedland areas would be at increased risk of collision as they did not have radar coverage to compensate for the lack of contact between air traffic control and light aircraft.
Airspace 2000 was drawn up last year by a team lead by Dick Smith, now deputy chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.
The new plan will reclassify the levels of service provided in different levels of airspace and redirect resources to areas of heavy air traffic such as the east coast of Australia.
It will also remove directed traffic information, provided by flight service officers, who do not separate aircraft in more remote areas but provide weather reports and notify aircraft of other aircraft in their area.
Airservices, the government body responsible for air traffic services, has already endorsed Airspace 2000.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority released a document yesterday calling for public comment on the new plan and said it was largely satisfied with a safety case presented by Airservices for Airspace 2000.

			<TEXT>QANTAS will relocate operations at London&apos;s Heathrow airport to Terminal Four from October 26, moving to the airport&apos;s newest terminal to join codeshare and alliance partner British Airways.
Qantas has based its London Heathrow operations at Terminal Three since 1962, when the terminal first opened.
But the newer Terminal Four houses most of BA&apos;s Heathrow operations, including intercontinental flights and services to Paris and Amsterdam.
This week, Qantas said basing the two airlines at the same terminal would cut connection times by up to one hour for passengers switching between aircraft on flights operated under the two airlines&apos; codeshare arrangements.
Also this week, Qantas and BA announced plans to codeshare on flights between Brisbane, Singapore and London, which Qantas said would free up capacity to be used on other routes.
The proposal, also due to begin on October 26, will cover five weekly BA flights between Brisbane and London, via Singapore, and three weekly Qantas flights between Brisbane and Singapore, which will connect with other BA services to London. The flights will now operate under joint BA/Qantas designated codes.
BA said it hoped to be offering daily flights between Brisbane, Singapore and London by next year under the codeshare agreement.
Qantas is due to release its results for 1996-97 next Thursday and is expected to better last year&apos;s net profit of $246 million.

			<TEXT>CARRYING defibrillators on commercial aircraft to treat passengers with heart disease saved both lives and money, a six-year program has shown.
Under the Qantas cardiac arrest program, carried out with Sydney&apos;s St Vincent&apos;s Hospital, defibrillators were installed in 53 of the airline&apos;s planes and cabin crews instructed in their use.
Between September, 1991 and January 4, 1997 the defibrillators were used on 109 occasions, 46 times for cardiac arrest.
The study found defibrillators successfully treated five cardiac arrests in flight and four at airport terminals.

			<TEXT>SOME companies might be a little reticent to boast about providing the inspiration for an extinct species of dinosaur, but not the folks at Qantas.
So confident is the airline of its lean, mean reputation that it made an announcement yesterday with the headline &quot;Prehistoric name to honour Qantas&quot;. Yes, it&apos;s the Qantassaurus, a dinosaur that foraged, if not flew, around Australia around 100 million years ago.
Dr Patricia Vickers-Rich, professor of palaeontology at Melbourne&apos;s Monash University, together with her husband Tom and a team of volunteers, discovered the skeleton of the Qantassaurus in Victoria&apos;s Otway Ranges.
The Qantassaurus is described as a small, agile vegetarian, less than a metre tall.
Dr Vickers-Rich wants to name the dinosaur after Qantas to thank the airline for its help during the four-year tour of the Great Russian Dinosaurs Exhibition through Australia and the US.
Apparently Qantas managing director James Strong doesn&apos;t mind his company being associated with extinct creatures and has already given the tribute his blessing.
But could the Qantassaurus fly?
Unfortunately Dr Vickers-Rich was unavailable to confirm this.
Still, kangaroos aren&apos;t meant to fly, either, and that fact hasn&apos;t hurt Qantas&apos; image.
The kiwi, however, has not had such a great track record. Two out of two airlines named after the flightless bird have gone broke in recent months.
NAB boss Don Argus is already making plans for life post-NAB, and it seems he is plotting his revenge against those who make life difficult for the banks.
Mr Argus told a Securities Institute of Australia lunch in Sydney yesterday that on leaving the NAB he would like to freelance for the Australian Bankers Association.
&quot;I would have a real party with some of the ill-informed comments about the industry,&quot; he said.
He also invited some of the &quot;noisy&quot; minority interests who believe a bank has a moral and social responsibility to the community to &quot;come to our organisation and I will show them dollar for dollar how much tax I pay and then, dollar for dollar, on where we place our community interest&quot;.
THE 26 underwriters to the Telstra float would no doubt be encouraged by the initial response to the setting of a float timetable.
The telecom giant&apos;s pre-float marketing campaign appears to have been an, errr, ringing success.
The carrier was deluged with calls from investors on the phone and hits in cyberspace seeking a guaranteed allocation of shares by reserving a prospectus, even though the television and print advertising campaign for the float does not kick off until Sunday.
Float officials said operators at the end of Telstra&apos;s freecall 1800 number in Melbourne had taken an average of 2000 calls an hour.
At lunchtime, a further 100 offer documents had been reserved through the float&apos;s Internet web site: http:/shareoffer.telstra.com.au.
Investors who reserve a prospectus, and then opt to invest in Telstra, will be entitled to 50 per cent more than the minimum public allocation of shares if the float is oversubscribed.
To help cope with enthusiasm for the ploy, which has seen some 1800 callers advised to phone back two or three hours later, Telstra will open another two phone centres by tomorrow.
CAR troubles have multiplied for Jim Byrnes, the former chauffeur to number-plate maker Alan Bond.
Byrnes&apos; Australian Credit Corp, now in liquidation, has been hit with another bill by the taxman, this time for $80,000 in unpaid fringe benefits tax.
The taxman - already pursuing ACC for $100,000 in unpaid group tax - suspects the red Bentley that was the staff car at ACC was used for more than just business purposes recently.
Byrnes predilection for flashy cars has already landed him in trouble with the North Sydney Local Court, where he is facing charges of obtaining $85,000 from finance company AGC by deception, allegedly to purchase a 1959 red Corvette.

			<TEXT>DELAYS and congestion at Sydney Airport have cost Qantas more than $270 million in the past three years, a former Qantas executive claimed yesterday.
Ian Oldmeadow, who has been retained by the airline as a senior consultant, said departure delays at the airport were 10 times worse than the average for Australian and overseas airports in the past 12 months, with up to 10 per cent of domestic flights delayed because of airport problems.
Mr Oldmeadow, who resigned as the airline&apos;s chief of operations earlier this year, was speaking at the Airports &apos;97 conference in Melbourne.
The Qantas claim, the first public statement by an airline on the cost of Sydney Airport&apos;s problems, counters the Federal Government&apos;s assertion that congestion at the airport has been largely eliminated.
The extra fuel consumed by delayed aircraft was likely to be the largest part of Qantas&apos; estimated bill.
&quot;If an airport is unduly congested ... then the airlines have to put more padding in their schedules to keep faith with the market, and in order to provide those buffers additional aircraft capacity has to be purchased even though it is not warranted by market demand,&quot; he said.
Mr Oldmeadow said Qantas&apos;s estimate of the cost of Sydney Airport delays dropped slightly in 1994-95, but rose again in 1995-96 to just over $90 million.
Both Qantas and Ansett have complained previously of the cost of Sydney Airport&apos;s problems, but neither have publicly named a dollar figure.
Ansett has cited delays at Sydney Airport and higher fuel prices as reasons why the airline recorded an operating loss of $18.6 million last year.
Earlier this month, the Government announced details of a slots system, which will allocate arrival and departure times to airlines at Sydney Airport.
It will also impose fines on airlines which do not comply with their allotted slots in an effort to discourage the scheduling of peak-period flights as close to each other as possible.
The imposition of a cap on aircraft movements of 80 movements an hour is another constraint on the airport.
However, the airport&apos;s flexibility increased substantially last year with the re-opening of the east-west runway and, more recently, northerly take-offs from the north-south runway.

			<TEXT>WHEN Hollywood nominated Qantas as the world&apos;s safest airline in the 1988 movie Rain Man, it brought drawbacks as well as free advertising.
Ever since Dustin Hoffman&apos;s cinematic, autistic character refused to board a plane that wasn&apos;t Qantas, the &quot;safest airline&quot; tag has stuck.
It is better than being known as a life-threatening airline but the &quot;safest&quot; label is also a potential handicap.
The disadvantage that Qantas management may notice, as they make significant changes to the company, is how the &quot;safest&quot; tag can limit their flexibility.
Price, comfort, inflight services and toys like personal videos all play a part when passengers choose their preferred airline, but much of the value within the Qantas brand is intangible.
Choosing Qantas can be an emotive decision based on perceptions - how many Australians feel a pang on seeing the flying kangaroo in a remote foreign airport? Creating and maintaining that public perception of safety is hugely important for airlines, and Qantas and Ansett treat the issue with almost religious zeal.
If an airline tries to instigate major changes in the way things are done, as Qantas and Ansett are doing now, they must be prepared to manage that public perception.
As the airline tagged the &quot;world&apos;s safest&quot;, Qantas is more vulnerable than most to speculation at every move it makes.
When Qantas laid off 53 engineering apprentices in May, and then retrenched another 132 engineering and maintenance employees, some unions hit Qantas where it hurts, accusing the airline of putting safety at risk in its drive to cut costs.
The media coverage that the lay-offs attracted, and the implication that Qantas&apos; staff numbers were shrinking, rankled at the airline, which responded with an advertising campaign to point out Qantas&apos; recent growth.
This week&apos;s news that Qantas will extend competitive tendering to include ground services at Sydney and other airports, is another step in a program to cut costs and improve profits while managing the safety image.
A big public relations test for Ansett and Qantas will come if they decide to tender large sections of the engineering and maintenance divisions.
British Airways, Qantas&apos; 25 per cent shareholder, has already rejected that option for at least three years. The reason was safety - BA said the world aircraft engineering market simply was not yet as sophisticated as they had hoped, although BA still believes that airlines eventually will not own their own engineering operations.
Qantas and Ansett recognise their safety reputation as one of their most important assets, which they vigorously protect. The 1994 nose-wheel landing of a Boeing 747 at Sydney airport cost Ansett millions of dollars and it was the public perception - reinforced by television and newspaper pictures - that did much of the damage.
Qantas would never reject the &quot;world&apos;s safest airline&quot; label but wearing that crown while restructuring the company will test the airline&apos;s public relations skills.
o o o
AS well as cutting costs, Ansett and Qantas want to earn more from existing customers.
Those passengers have made airport shopping one of the world&apos;s biggest retailing sectors - in Australia, the estimated size of duty-free shopping alone is about $500 million each year. The growth in airport retailing is one reason why the sale of Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth airports raised $3.3 billion.
So far, Qantas and Ansett have won little of that money with their inflight shopping. But the launch of Qantas&apos; new catalogue and promotional campaign this week, after Ansett&apos;s expanded catalogue released earlier this year, signals a new push for passengers&apos; spending money.
The airlines deny they want to compete with the duty free retailers on the ground and point out that they cannot compete with the range of products offered by shops like Downtown Duty Free.
Instead, the airlines want to offer their passengers a service.
If you&apos;re bored, with money to burn on a 12-hour flight and no presents for the family, then you might agree it is a service you need. The underlying motive, however, is more revenue, and snaring just a small slice of what is spent on the ground would make both airlines happy indeed. Qantas&apos; safety record rated a mention in Rain Man, starring Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman.

			<TEXT>ANSETT and Qantas announced plans yesterday to cut costs and squeeze more revenue from their businesses, with Qantas relaunching its in-flight duty free operations and Ansett extending electronic tickets to travel agencies.
Qantas hopes the revamp announced yesterday will increase in-flight duty free revenue by 20 per cent, although officials would not disclose current earnings from the operation.
But in-flight services manager Stephen McIntyre said current sales were small compared with annual revenues of around $500 million for duty free retailers on the ground in Australia.
As well as a new catalogue, more in-flight promotion and a marketing campaign, Qantas flight attendants will use Eftpos technology to replace vouchers and swipe machines for payments.
Qantas is considering the sale of products on domestic flights, but the range would not be as wide, or tax free.
Melbourne and Brisbane airports are both owned and managed by overseas operators with a strong retailing background.
BAA, which heads a group managing Melbourne, has developed Britain&apos;s airports into retailing centres while Brisbane is managed by the Schipol airport team from The Netherlands.
Qantas put its in-flight shopping operations out for tender last year, and awarded the contract to its existing in-house team.
Earlier this year, Ansett International also launched an expanded duty-free catalogue for in-flight sales.
Yesterday Ansett&apos;s domestic arm said electronic ticketing would be extended to travel agents in November.
The &quot;E-ticket&quot; system confirms bookings on a computer, and passengers receive a receipt but not a paper ticket.
About one-third of Ansett&apos;s direct sales for domestic air travel are electronically ticketed, and the airline hopes the paper ticket will be almost obsolete within three years. The system will eventually extend to Ansett International.

			<TEXT>A QANTAS jet taking 49 people to Uluru was forced to return to Alice Springs when its landing mechanism failed yesterday.
The 76-seat Airlink British Aerospace 146 jet was about to land at a runway near Uluru about 2.15pm, a Qantas spokeswoman said.
She said the plane&apos;s captain decided to fly the 40 minutes back to Alice Springs because its airport was better equipped to deal with an emergency landing.
&quot;The flight QF92 landed safely at Alice Springs after a malfunction developed in the landing gear,&quot; the spokeswoman said.
&quot;The flight crew manually lowered the landing gear and the aircraft landed without incident,&quot; she said.
She said a similar type of jet was flown in from Perth to fly the 49 passengers to Uluru last night.

			<TEXT>A HOT air balloon with 13 people on board was within range of passenger aircraft, a Qantas pilot making an approach into Sydney Airport reported yesterday morning.
The Qantas pilot complained to Airservices Australia that a balloon, two miles north-west of Westmead, was estimated to be at 3500ft, within controlled air space for passenger aircraft.
All aircraft approaching Sydney&apos;s Kingsford Smith Airport were advised to be aware of the possibility of a hot air balloon in their path.
Balloon pilot John Allen, of Cloud Nine Balloon Flights, Baulkham Hills, denied the report, saying the flight was trouble-free and within airspace restrictions.
Hot air balloons are required to fly between 1000 and 2500 feet over residential areas.
&quot;The pilot needs his eyes checked if he thinks we were flying at 3500ft. We didn&apos;t go above 2400,&quot; said Mr Allen.

			<TEXT>QANTAS is negotiating a new direct route to Europe over China and Russia which would save the airline millions of dollars a year in operating costs.
The move would abandon the traditional Kangaroo route to Europe over India and the Middle East, and cut about an hour off flying times to London and Franfurt.
With the operating cost of a Boeing 747-400 estimated at $US8000 an hour, Qantas stands to save about $12 million a year by switching to the proposed route over China.
The direct savings in time and money by overflying China could be increased by avoiding the growing air traffic congestion over the Indian subcontinent.
Qantas recently hosted meetings with senior Chinese Government officials to discuss planning for new air routes with further talks in Beijing this week.
An airline spokesman said talks had been taking place &quot;for some time&quot; on the prospects of rerouting the twice-daily Boeing 747 services to London and daily services to Frankfurt in Germany over China.
The three weekly services to Rome are likely to continue via the Middle East. But London and Frankfurt services would be routed from the present Qantas hubs in Singapore and Bangkok over western China and Siberia to Europe, with &quot;significant savings&quot; in aircraft operating costs.
&quot;Negotiations are still proceeding to gain Chinese consent,&quot; the spokesman said.
The move would require the development of new air navigation aids, with Qantas already involved in plans with Boeing and international aviation authorities.
Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific, and UK airlines Virgin and British Airways are developing similar proposals for &quot;short-cut&quot; flights between Hong Kong and London.

			<TEXT>THIS week brought some particularly good news for the residents of Sydney news suggesting that sanity can sometimes prevail in high places.
The Central Sydney Bus Priority Scheme has introduced special bus lanes in the city&apos;s centre, reducing road space for general traffic. To achieve this, there has been a remarkable display of co-operation between six separate authorities with an interest in Sydney&apos;s public transport, including the police and the city council.
The inevitable, intentional effect of the new measures will be to make life more difficult for any private motorist crazy enough to take a car unnecessarily into Sydney&apos;s CBD. (Canberra, with far less acute problems of congestion and pollution than Sydney&apos;s, has long since demonstrated the effectiveness of giving buses preferential treatment on the road.) Governments can plead and propagandise all they like about the need for people to make more use of public transport in urban areas, but we are so wedded to the comfort and convenience of our cars that the only way to change our behaviour is to make the use of the car less comfortable and less convenient. More bus lanes is a good start.
The next step, of course, is for governments to prove their commitment to public transport use by virtually eliminating on-street car parking in the centre of our cities. Revenue from both meters and fines must be powerfully seductive, but there are still plenty of us who are prepared to risk a fine for the convenience of parking in a city street. Once that opportunity no longer exists, it will take us no time at all to decide that clogging the city with cars was sheer lunacy.
The principle here is transparent: if you want to change someone&apos;s behaviour, there&apos;s no point in first trying to &quot;change their minds&quot;. As random breath testing proved in the case of drink driving, you have to intervene directly in the driving environment if you are to have any hope of effecting change. Once you modify the environment, behaviour quickly adapts and then - surprise, surprise - attitudes follow.
But sanity does not always prevail in Sydney ... and not every public authority is as enlightened on the subject of persuasion as those who conceived the Bus Priority Scheme. The Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, for instance, is apparently contemplating spending public money on what sounds like a textbook example of the wild goose chase.
SOCOG is angered by the fact that two of Australia&apos;s most prominent brand names, Qantas and National Australia Bank, have dared to feature leading athletes in their current advertising - three years before the Olympics - possibly creating the impression (if anyone&apos;s interested enough to speculate) that they are sponsoring the Sydney Games, which they are not.
Worse, from SOCOG&apos;s point of view, is the fact that Ansett and Westpac competitors of the offending companies - have already coughed up large quantities of cash for the privilege of being identified as official Olympic sponsors. SOCOG has described the Qantas and NAB advertising campaigns as &quot;ambush marketing&quot; (suggesting, if the military analogy is anything to go by, that they regard them as dangerously effective).
Now comes the really silly part. SOCOG is so outraged by the two campaigns that it is proposing to spend taxpayers&apos; money on a campaign of its own designed to &quot;shame&quot; Qantas and the NAB into desisting. Those naughty advertisers will be exposed for having had the temerity to mention sport in their advertising and to associate themselves with certain athletes. (Don&apos;t they know that SOCOG owns sport?) Whose minds are SOCOG trying to change, I wonder. Do they think a &quot;shaming&quot; campaign will actually persuade muscular giants like Qantas and NAB to abandon expensive and well-established advertising strategies? Or do they think that airline and bank customers, discovering the truth, will boycott two of their favourite brands and flock to their competitors, solely on the grounds of their Olympic sponsorship?
I&apos;d put my money on a negative outcome, on both counts. (By the way, I can&apos;t find a strong, tangible consumer benefit in either of the existing &quot;athlete&quot; campaigns, so I suspect they&apos;ll both fade away ere long, with or without a push from SOCOG.) [][] Two weeks ago, I referred to a Family Court case involving a mother moving with her daughters from Cairns to Bendigo, leaving the father in Cairns. I inadvertently implied that the father agreed with and/or supported the stance of the Lone Fathers Association and was outraged by the result of the court&apos;s decision. This is not the case, and I apologise unreservedly for any embarrassment I may have caused him.

			<TEXT>IT is only a matter of time before plane travellers buy tickets over the Internet but Qantas has no timetable for introducing such a service, according to a senior executive.
Qantas group general manager (commercial policy) Denis Adams said the airline had no &quot;internal timetable&quot; for online ticketing and there were still issues to be resolved.
He was talking at the launch of a redesigned Qantas Web site (www.qantas.com.au [http://www.qantas.com.au/]), which allows frequent flyers to check their points tally, lets freight customers track their shipments and gives customers access to real-time arrival and departure details.
Mr Adams said the new features were the first in a series of developments planned for the site, and which aimed to give customers global access to the latest information about their airline&apos;s products and services.
However, there were two issues which needed to be solved before online ticketing could be introduced.
&quot;There&apos;s the functionality side of the development which has to take place and that&apos;s a fairly complex route,&quot; he said.
&quot;It&apos;s not so much in terms of the technology but the development of front ends which are user-friendly compared with the industry-based computer systems.&quot;
Another issue was credit card security. Mr Adams said there were still concerns relating to secure transactions in Australia which needed to be resolved.
&quot;There are some high-priced purchases in the travel area and so we&apos;ve got to be careful.&quot;
Online purchasing was &quot;inevitable but we haven&apos;t got an internal timetable&quot; for the service, Mr Adams said.
But online ticketing would not spell the end of travel agents.
&quot;I don&apos;t see it as changing the distribution channels,&quot; he said.
&quot;The current distribution environment will be replicated in this new environment.
&quot;It&apos;s just a new piece of communication technology, but I don&apos;t see it changing the agent&apos;s circumstances.&quot;
The new-look Qantas site, developed by graphic design company Red Square, went up on the Web last Friday.
Qantas official Carolyn Evans said the site had grown rapidly since its launch in February, 1996.
The redesigned site allows frequent flyers to check the balance of their accumulated points by entering PIN numbers. They can also look at points credited from the past 20 flights and from non-flight activity, such as partner hotels and credit cards.
The site features a calculator which allows users to specify a trip, tells them how many points are required, and how many points they have left after the trip.
Freight clients use the site to track the progress of their shipment by keying in the appropriate waybill number.
This links directly to the Qantas Freight database to give real-time information on whether a consignment has departed, is in transit or has arrived or is being processed by customs.
There are also flight schedules for the next 360 days and routing details and times.

			<TEXT>QANTAS has revamped its internet site allowing customers to check on frequent flyer points, confirm flights and plan their own itineraries.
The site includes real time arrival and departure times and allows freight customers to check their deliveries.
&quot;Qantas wants to provide its existing and potential customers with instant access 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world to the latest information about its products and services,&quot; group general manager of commercial policy Denis Adams said.
The new site is essentially an updated version of the airline&apos;s first home-page launched in February 1996.
&quot;People can instantly check corporate, financial, employment, operational and historic information about the airline or trace its development through articles, news releases and fact files about its history,&quot; Mr Adams said.
Frequent Flyer members are able to access the service and check on how many points they have accumulated by entering their individual membership and security numbers.
The Qantas web site can be accessed atwww.qantas.com.au [http://www.qantas.com.au/].

			<TEXT>A TEENAGER who learned about bombs on the Internet threatened to blow up a Qantas jet in mid-air unless he was paid $505,000, a court heard yesterday.
The 17-year-old boy &quot;from a well-known and highly respected family&quot; allegedly called Qantas almost 90 minutes after the jet took off from Sydney on Friday, carrying 95 passengers plus crew bound for Hong Kong.
The youth threatened to use a &quot;facility&quot; to activate a bomb if police were contacted, Lidcombe Children&apos;s Court was told.
Police said the teenager used the Internet to study terrorism and bomb-making and claimed he had the means to destroy the Boeing 747-400 in mid-air.
He allegedly called Qantas security at 1.40pm on Friday using the pseudonym &quot;Mr Brown&quot; the same name used by Peter Pasquale Macari in 1971 to extort $500,000 from the airline.
But the teenager was arrested on Saturday at his home in Belmore, in Sydney&apos;s inner west, after he tried to have a taxi collect his money from the Spanish Inn Motor Lodge on the Hume Highway at Strathfield.
Wearing black jeans and a maroon sloppy joe in court yesterday, he sat silently throughout his court appearance as his parents flew to Sydney from Queensland, where they own a restaurant and motel complex.
The teenager, who cannot be named, moved to Sydney two years ago to live with his brother while finishing his final years at high school and had never been in trouble, his solicitor Brenda Duchen told the court.
The court was not told anything to suggest a bomb had actually been made or planted on the jet.
Prosecutor Sergeant Dave Perry said the youth told the airline&apos;s security &quot;an explosive device had been placed on Qantas Flight 27, which had departed Sydney at 12.15pm for Hong Kong&quot;. &quot;A demand was placed upon Qantas to pay the sum of $505,000 in used bank notes,&quot; Sgt Perry said.
&quot;He went on to say he had the facility to activate an explosive device, which had been placed on the aircraft, while it was en route.
&quot;A further threat was intimated that if Qantas was to contact police, he would detonate the incendiary device.&quot; Sgt Perry said five telephone calls were made to Qantas, outlining instructions for paying the money.
&quot;During one of these conversations, it is alleged he came to an agreement with Qantas for the original demand to be halved to $250,000,&quot; Sgt Perry said. A covert police operation was launched and a bag, bearing a Qantas logo, was sealed with masking tape and taken by courier in a controlled delivery to the Spanish Inn.
The teenager then allegedly went to the motel and booked in to a room under a false name.
He went to his room and called Qantas again, Sgt Perry said.
He then allegedly went back to reception and paid for his room, leaving instructions to pay a courier when a package was delivered to the hotel.
He allegedly told the reception staff he would pick up the delivery later that night.
But just after 10am on Saturday, he allegedly contacted staff at the motel and asked if an &quot;associate&quot; could collect the bag.
A taxi driver went to the motel with the intention of collecting the bag but, after speaking with staff, he drove to the boy&apos;s Belmore address under police surveillance, the court heard.
He spoke to the teenager and then returned to the motel, took the bag and drove back to the Belmore address where the youth took possession of the bag, Sgt Perry said.
&quot;A warrant was executed on the premises and it is alleged salient information and documents were seized lawfully, which connect the youth with the charges,&quot; Sgt Perry said.
&quot;It is alleged he accessed the Internet and gleaned information relating to terrorist-type activity and gained information relating to the construction and detonation of explosive devices.&quot;
The teenager was arrested just before 5pm and charged with making a demand with a threat to destroy or damage an aircraft and demanding money with menaces - charges which carry a maximum jail term of 14 years.
Ms Duchen said the youth had &quot;never been in trouble with anyone, let alone the law&quot;. She said he was from a well-known and highly respected family and his parents would be able to offer substantial surety for bail.
Paul Gardiner JP remanded him in custody to reappear at Bidura Children&apos;s Court today.

			<TEXT>GOVERNMENT figures released yesterday have provided more evidence that Ansett and Qantas face tough conditions, with worrying signs that the domestic air travel market may be shrinking after years of sustained growth.
Department of Transport figures for January show domestic airlines in Australia recorded a 2 per cent drop in revenue (or paying) passengers over January last year, while load factors fell from 76.1 per cent to 73.9 per cent.
The lower load factors suggest the market has failed to grow as strongly as the airlines predicted, with available capacity rising 3.3 per cent over the same period.
But improvements on longer-haul routes have helped revenue passenger kilometres - another industry measure of growth increase by 0.4 per cent.
The government statistics cover domestic operations for Qantas and Ansett but no longer illustrate market share figures separating the two airlines&apos; performance.
Qantas released its own statistics for January earlier this year which showed a 3.3 per cent increase in passenger numbers and suggested Ansett wore most of the January dip in traffic.
However, Qantas&apos; own figures also showed the airline&apos;s load factors fell 1.5 per cent in January to 78.5 per cent.
Signs of a sluggish domestic market first appeared in statistics for November, released last month by the DoT.
The November drop in passenger numbers of 1.1 per cent was the first slump recorded since the government began compiling monthly figures in July 1994.
Revenue passenger kilometres increased in November, but at a low rate of 1.5 per cent, and was out-
stripped by available seat kilometres, which grew by 5.8 per cent.
An increase of capacity over revenue passenger kilometres suggests airlines have too many seats in the market, reflected by the drop in November load factors from 73.3 per cent to 70.3 per cent.
Figures for December, traditionally strong thanks to Christmas holidays, picked up again, although load factors were still lower than last year.
Now the January figures have dipped again and traffic on some regional routes showed alarming drops in passenger numbers, including a 20 per cent fall between Sydney and Maroochydore, 14.8 per cent between Melbourne and Launceston and 10 per cent between Sydney and Coolangatta.
Both airlines have instigated major cost-cutting programs this year, as one approach to the sluggish domestic market.
While Qantas is likely to report a higher profit for 1996-97, thanks in part to selling its 19.9 per cent stake in Air New Zealand, the Ansett group will report an operating loss of about $3 million. Qantas shares, which hit a new high of $3.15 earlier this week, closed 3c lower yesterday at $3.10.
Tourism authorities have confirmed that Qantas will announce new schedules for international services from Cairns next week but have denied reports that the airline plans to cease all international flights from north Queensland.
The Cairns newspaper yesterday reported that Qantas would &quot;pull the plug&quot; on international services from the city but Steve Noakes, managing director of the Far North Queensland Promotion Bureau, said the reports were incorrect.
&quot;There will be some schedule changes in early October or November ... to a couple of Queensland services but there is no suggestion that Qantas is pulling international services out of Cairns,&quot; he said.
Qantas has already instigated code-sharing on routes between Brisbane, Cairns and Tokyo with Japan Airlines.
Under the agreement, JAL operates daily flights from Brisbane to Tokyo while Qantas has taken over the daily CairnsTokyo service.

			<TEXT>CONSUMERS&apos; desire for free travel and telecommunications equipment from reward programs has seen annual spending patterns on the Telstra and Qantas Telstra Visa cards increase from an average $3000 to $30,000.
The ANZ Bank/Telstra Visa card turns two tomorrow and has 820,000 card holders with a target of 1 million by the end of June next year.
But the key for Telstra has been to lock in the cards&apos; high-spending customer base as deregulation looms.
Program originator Bob Gillman said the cards had also been a boon for ANZ -80 per cent of card holders did not have a previous relationship with the bank and card spending had increased - and for reward merchants whose incremental business had grown.
He said average spending on a normal Visa card was $3000 a year.
The Telstra Visa card is recording three times that amount, while the Qantas Telstra Visa card has five times and the Gold products of both have 10 times that spend.
While travel is the most popular reward, particularly for Qantas card holders, Telstra Visa card holders want free facsimiles, answer machines and mobile phones.
Mr Gillman predicted that about 25 per cent of card holders would redeem these products but that figure has swelled to about 60 per cent.
And for every answer machine sold, Telstra receives $75 per annum in incremental revenue.
Research just completed by Frank Small &amp; Associates among 600 card holders found that 82 per cent were satisfied with the card and 36 per cent said having the card meant they would remain Telstra customers.
&quot;All this means is that we have lots of relationships and most of them we already had relationships with. So why is Telstra doing it? Obviously, it&apos;s because of deregulation next month how do we build that loyalty and try and hang on to our customers,&quot; Mr Gillman said.
&quot;When you quantify (the 36 per cent) against the base of high-spending customers, it&apos;s big money.&quot;
These customers are valuable to Telstra: they spend 21/2 times more than the average on IDD calls, 70 per cent have mobile phones and 65 per cent have answer machines.
Qantas frequent flyers are also high users of home phones, mobiles and Telecards.
Mr Gillman said the program had also benefited rewards partners. Mobil&apos;s national market share is 19 per cent, while 58 per cent of card holders purchased Mobil products.
The Vox Group has 40 per cent market share, while 73 per cent of card holders purchased from Vox retailers; Medibank Private has 25 per cent market share while 56 per cent of card holders used it; BBC has 8 per cent of the market while 28 per cent of card holders buy its products and Thrifty has 15 per cent of the market while 49 per cent of card holders rented its cars.
A key element of the Telstra program has been its bonus merchants because, unlike some of its competitors, the cards do not offer one reward point for every $1 spent.
Mr Gillman said the program was looking at ways to improve but he would not elaborate.
&quot;We&apos;re looking at ways to make the program more lucrative and adding value to the program. We&apos;re looking at what our competitors do and will meet them head on wherever we can,&quot; he said.
&quot;If you use just the base (rewards) points, we don&apos;t look so great. That&apos;s the importance of the bonus partners but, to the program&apos;s credit, we have made demonstrable inroads into the market shares of various partners.&quot;
Mr Gillman, who was general manager of the program, will now consult to Telstra part-time as he begins his own business consulting to companies in New Zealand, Indonesia and Hong Kong for similar programs.
His partners are Pinpoint Marketing, which developed the proprietary software for the Telstra program to track the rewards, and another as yet unnamed US company. Vision: Bob Gillman says Telstra hopes to make the scheme more lucrative - Picture: Chris Pavlich.

			<TEXT>DON&apos;T underestimate the importance of the new Ansett route between Sydney and Shanghai.
It&apos;s just over 25 years since Australia staged its first trade mission in Beijing.
This week, Kate Dunmore McLean, an Australian businesswoman operating in Shanghai, spoke movingly of that occasion when a Qantas jet arrived.
&quot;Here was a piece of Australia coming out of the misty sky. Australian women held their children up to see the aircraft as it landed; many had tears in their eyes,&quot; she said.
Ms McLean said the increasing direct flights between Australia and China not only underpinned the growing business ties between the two nations but also provided psychological benefits for expats.
This columnist was a guest on the inaugural Ansett flight.

			<TEXT>THE Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) yesterday lifted a ban on Qantas workers taking industrial action over the airline&apos;s moves to contract out ground service work.
Commissioner Tony Wilks lifted the order after the Australian Services Union (ASU) guaranteed to bring any irreconcilable disputes over competitive tendering to the commission before taking industrial action.
While lifting the order yesterday, Commissioner Wilks directed the ASU to fully comply with stop work meeting rules in their enterprise agreement.
He also directed Qantas not to refuse permission for stop work meetings without good reason.

			<TEXT>QANTAS will launch 46 new flights between key business and leisure destinations in its winter domestic schedules in a bid to improve flexibility and provide greater choice for passengers.
A Qantas general manager, Geoff Dixon, said the addition of two new aircraft to the fleet allowed for the busier timetable.
&quot;The winter schedules represent an increase of slightly more than 4 per cent over the existing capacity,&quot; he said.
A spokesman said the schedule changes were merely a seasonal adjustment, creating neither jobs nor fare increases.
The timetable offers a big boost to services between Adelaide and Brisbane, Brisbane and Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide and Brisbane and Cairns.
There will also be additional Saturday services from Sydney and Brisbane to Darwin and Melbourne to Alice Springs.
As well as business customers, Qantas is pursuing the tourism market with Alice Springs services offering connections to Uluru and Darwin.
The adjusted schedule will also feature flights from Sydney to Cairns and Townsville, with the Sydney-Townsville service bolstered with extra flights during school holidays.

			<TEXT>Qantas is learning a lot from its British shareholder as it grapples with change, reports aviation writer Michelle Gilchrist QANTAS is in for an increasingly turbulent time in coming months as it tries to drive down costs, reviews asset sales and work practices and examines contracting out some services - all moves likely to bring staff and senior management into conflict.
But if managing director James Strong and his team need a sympathetic ear they need look no further than British Airways, Qantas&apos; 25 per cent shareholder and close alliance partner since 1993.
BA&apos;s experience runs parallel to Qantas&apos; in many ways. The British airline has already tackled, and is continuing to face, issues of costsavings, retrenchments, deregulation and outsourcing.
However, while BA is probably one or two steps ahead of Qantas along the cost-cutting path, it would be wrong to assume the Australian airline aims to replicate its biggest shareholder. While Qantas works closely with BA and its three directors on the Qantas board, including BA chief executive Robert Ayling, Strong insists Qantas will do things its own way.
&quot;There is no doubt that our special relationship does enable us to work more closely with (BA) than with anyone else,&quot; he says.
&quot;We exchange ideas and proposals and, obviously, we do want our products to be reasonably compatible.
&quot;But you certainly could not say we are only interested in what BA is doing. In terms of an airline deciding on product standards and innovation and so on, you look at every airline around the world and other service areas as well.
&quot;You don&apos;t get all your ideas from one industry.
&quot;At the commercial level, each airline follows its own tactics and priorities separately but there is a lot of discussion between us, so we do benefit to a greater extent than if there was no business relationship between the two airlines.&quot;
The announcement of Qantas&apos; $550 million overhaul plans late last month should have been a public relations doddle.
Here was Qantas being pro-active, investing in new technology and cabin fitouts in a move Strong described as a virtual relaunch of the airline.
However, it soon became obvious that the large media contingent which crammed into the small conference room at the airline&apos;s Mascot headquarters wasn&apos;t there to ask about seat pitch or new video systems.
Retrenchments in Qantas&apos; engineering division provided the angle and the media wanted more.
Strong is getting heartily sick of the focus on job losses. But such publicity is likely to continue as the airline pursues its cost-cutting program the emotional reaction to the job cuts is the flipside of having a brand with such strong emotive ties for many Australians.
BA, also a national flag carrier, is facing a similar response to its program for change and Qantas is looking with interest at its experience, as are other world airlines with no connection to BA. Many airlines are faced with problems that BA has partly tackled - high costs, an employee and service culture based on government ownership and new competition in increasingly deregulated markets.
Still, there are obvious parallels between Qantas and BA. Both are selling off non-core businesses such as resorts, examining the possibility of contracting out some operations and undertaking a push to drive down operating costs by hundreds of millions of dollars.
In program Step Change, announced last year, BA set an annual cost savings target of pound stg. 1 billion ($2.13 billion) by March 2000. Already it claims it has reached the pound stg. 600 million mark through measures including the contracting out of catering and vehicle maintenance services and setting redundancy targets of around 5000 staff or 10 per cent of its workforce.
Similarly, Qantas has its Accelerated Change program with annual cost savings targets of at least $470 million. Employee reduction targets are sensitive - Strong will only say the program will affect the entire airline in a &quot;measured and considered way&quot;. He rejects union claims that thousands of jobs will be lost from a total workforce of about 30,000.
Both airlines face the threat of ongoing strike action by staff over their plans. This week, BA ground staff at Heathrow and Gatwick airports were due to vote on industrial action in protest over the plans to sell BA&apos;s catering unit.
Results of another ballot, this time by cabin crew, will be known later this month.
Qantas&apos; skirmishes with unions have been well documented, although none have so far resulted in strike action.
Although BA and Qantas face similar issues, they will not duplicate each other in their response.
&quot;We often will be doing the same thing but we will do it in our own particular style ... it would be wrong to slavishly follow anyone, because the only thing you can slavishly follow is your own research and readings of what your customers want,&quot; Strong says. &quot;You could only say that everybody watches everybody else ... but, in the end, you really have to tailor your approach to local circumstances.&quot;
BA is likely to incur some emotive publicity of its own next week if, as expected, it announces a new corporate image with a price tag of up to pound stg. 50 million even as it continues to shed staff. The new blue and grey livery with abstract artworks and a softer, more curved logo will replace its familiar Union Jack logo. &quot;Our livery and image is traditional and its Britishness is perceived by some as being aloof and stuffy,&quot; a BA spokesman said last year.
In contrast, the relaunch of Qantas last month stuck firmly with tradition. Although it introduced a new logo with more curves, the airline retains the flying kangaroo - Qantas without the red joey is unimaginable. The airline even went back to its original designer, not looking for a dramatic break away from an image that has worked well for many years.
The different regulatory and industrial relations environments for the two airlines also necessitates different responses.
BA is pushing for an open-skies agreement with the US to allow its proposed mega-alliance with American Airlines to go ahead, albeit later than planned.
In Australia, it is hard to imagine Qantas urging the Federal Government to pursue open-skies agreements. The Government has said it will retain bilateral agreements, probably partly reflecting the views of Qantas.
BA is a few steps ahead of Qantas in its financial performance, although both are profitable, unlike many other airlines.
BA was the world&apos;s most profitable airline in 1995, surpassing Singapore Airlines, with a net profit of pound stg. 500 million. In 1996, its result rose to pound stg. 553 million, on revenue of pound stg. 8.4 billion, a yield of about 6.5 per cent.
Qantas cannot make the same claim, reporting a $246.7 million net profit for 1995-96 on revenue of $7.6 billion, a yield of about 3.2 per cent, and an interim net profit for 1996-97 of $151 million on $4 billion in revenue, representing a yield of 3.7 per cent.
Qantas has used the experience of BA in designing new international first-class cabins, with more information on these developments likely later this month.
The airline believes the concept is so valuable it has applied for a patent. BA has also patented its first-class cabins, which are based on a &quot;cocoon&quot; design with seats that convert to flat beds.
But the BA experience was only a starting point for Qantas, which last month said the new first-class cabins would differ significantly from the BA product.
Qantas commercial manager Geoff Dixon said then the airline&apos;s $550 million spending plans - for new cabins and a $330 million inflight entertainment system - were a good demonstration of the airline&apos;s independence from BA.
&quot;We are going with a different interactive (entertainment) supplier ... we have chosen seats completely different to theirs ... and we have gone for different economy seats,&quot; he says. &quot;I suppose you could have mounted a case that if we had all bought them together it could have been cheaper but our international (class) has a much bigger percentage of long-haul flying.&quot;
Dixon said airline passengers had strong possessive feelings about flying &quot;their&quot; airline and Qantas would continue to maintain a distinct Australian image despite its British partner.
&quot;We want all of the benefits (of an alliance) but we don&apos;t want to be in a world alliance where everything is the same,&quot; he said.

			<TEXT>THE US and New Zealand have signed a preliminary &quot;open skies&quot; agreement that will deregulate air traffic between the two countries and have ramifications for Air New Zealand, its part-owned alliance partner, Ansett, and rival Qantas.
The deregulation could potentially lead to lower airfares for passengers between New Zealand and the US, if existing or new airlines decide to enter the market and push down prices.
However, the implications for third-country airlines flying through New Zealand to the US are less clear.
There is, so far, little indication of how &quot;beyond rights&quot; for third-country airlines will be affected and whether Qantas would face indirect competition.
The agreement covers passenger and cargo traffic and appears to have given some limited beyond rights to US airlines flying cargo through New Zealand to third countries.
Ansett and Qantas already have strong links with the dominant airlines on the New Zealand-US routes.
Ansett is half-owned by Air NZ and code-shares all flights with its partner across the Tasman. Air NZ has code-sharing in place with United Airlines between New Zealand and the US, and Ansett is also looking to extend its relationship with United.
Qantas is part-owned by British Airways, which is trying to seal a wide-ranging alliance with American Airlines - the other big US airline operating across the Pacific.
The US-New Zealand agreement will not take effect until it is formally signed, with no date set yet. However, last week a US government spokesman said it would be ratified &quot;within weeks&quot;. The agreement is the latest brokered by the US, which wants to sign more in the Asia-Pacific region after agreements with Singapore, Taiwan and Brunei.
Malaysia is expected to sign an &quot;open skies&quot; agreement with the US shortly and South Korea has also entered talks.
However, Australia has resisted such agreements, preferring to negotiate greater capacity for airlines through bilateral arrangements.
Qantas will double flights from Australia to China from August, operating four weekly flights from Sydney to Beijing, via Shanghai.
Qantas flagged plans to operate four weekly flights last August, when it began services to Shanghai.
This weekend, Ansett makes its debut flight to Shanghai, where it will offer twice weekly flights. Ansett is also believed to be investigating options to take passengers on to Beijing.
Ansett was originally due to begin services to Shanghai earlier this year but attributed the delay to aircraft availability.

			<TEXT>QANTAS refuses to bow out of the Olympic sponsorship race although beaten for the right to be the official airline for the 2000 Games.
The carrier yesterday began an aggressive advertising campaign to link it with the nation&apos;s leading athletes over the next four years.
Sports stars spot-lighted in the two new advertisements include Olympic dual gold medallists Kieren Perkins and the Awesome Foursome, swimming gold medallist Susie O&apos;Neill and track silver medallist Cathy Freeman.
Similar to the Kate Ceberano and James Blundell &quot;I Still Call Australia Home&quot; campaign, the ads depict the dedication, determination and emotion associated with elite sport on the world stage. The advertisements will go to air during the next week.
Qantas has denied any notion that the new ads are a blatant attempt at ambush marketing designed to steal the thunder of official Olympic airline Ansett.
Geoff Dixon, the group executive general manager commercial, said that the campaign had nothing to do with the Sydney Olympic Games. He said 40 sports personalities were engaged to complement the $550 million relaunch of the airline&apos;s product and customer services.
&quot;We are a Commonwealth Games sponsor and a longtime supporter of Australian sport.
&quot;Over the years, the airline has carried just about every national sporting team, as well as thousands of individual sportsmen and women, to and from the arenas of international competition.
&quot;We believe our new sporting image campaign is a natural development of those relationships in an era when the media coverage of sport is virtually wall-to-wall through broadcast and pay television.&quot;

			<TEXT>QANTAS will lose two senior managers under a reshuffle aimed at reducing costs.
Ian Oldmeadow, poached from Ansett Australia to become operations manager, will leave the airline in July as his job becomes subsumed by the formation of a new super-division.
Mr Oldmeadow joined Qantas in July, 1994, after launching the Ansett International operations.
His defection caused major concern for Ansett.
Qantas managing director, James Strong, said yesterday Mr Oldmeadow would leave the airline in July, together with the manager of associated business, Norman Fricker, but that both men would &quot;continue to be available for consulting work&quot; for the airline.
Mr Strong said the management restructure was part of the continuing attack on costs at Qantas.
The latest management moves would help to reduce the group&apos;s management and overhead costs, in line with the efforts to improve the efficiency and productivity throughout the airline group, he said.
However, the airline would not spell out the savings from the management reshuffle.
Under the changes, Doug Gillies will head up a division which incorporates operations, regional airlines, engineering and maintenance, and industrial and human relations.
The present Finance Director, Mr Brian Toomey, will add responsibility for airports, catering and freight to his finance role.
And Mr Geoff Dixon would take responsibility for the Queensland resorts (which are on the market) and inflight services in his existing commercial portfolio.

			<TEXT>QANTAS has retrenched two of its six most senior managers, including the head of its industrial relations team, as part of an ongoing cost-reduction program.
In the restructure, announced yesterday, Mr Ian Oldmeadow and Mr Norm Fricker will leave Qantas on June 1. However, the two could continue to work for Qantas on a consultancy basis.
Earlier this month, Qantas sacked 53 engineering and maintenance apprentices and 132 engineering staff. But Mr Strong maintained Qantas was continuing to grow, citing its $550 million investment program, announced last week.
&quot;There has been a perception created by a small group of people who are affected by the tougher way in which the business has been run to try to portray Qantas as shrinking,&quot; managing director Mr James Strong said said on Sunday. &quot;The reality is the opposite.&quot; The Australian Democrats said yesterday they would seek Opposition support for a notice of motion to condemn Qantas and the Federal Government over the apprentice sackings.
Democrats Senator John Woodley hoped to table the notice in Parliament this week. He said the Government had &quot;created a climate for these kind of retrenchments&quot;. Mr Oldmeadow&apos;s portfolio covered industrial relations and human resources. Mr Fricker was responsible for regional airlines, catering, purchasing and property, freight and resorts.

			<TEXT>NO dress codes apply for the casino in the sky. All you&apos;ll need is an international air ticket, a credit card and well, nothing better to do on your next long-haul flight.
This week Qantas moved closer to joining the growing circle of international airlines who want passengers to spend more money on board a plane instead of at their final destination.
Using an interactive video screen installed at your seat, swipe a credit card and choose from a selection of games blackjack, poker and most traditional casino games.
If you win, that will be credited to your card - if you lose, you&apos;ll be debited. Qantas will install in-flight entertainment systems at every seat, for every international passenger, from April next year.
Passengers will have access to up to 20 movie and news channels, audio, computer games and duty-free shopping.
But the ability to offer gambling has drawn the most attention, both from the public, government and airlines.
Airlines, including Qantas, will have to win federal government approval to operate inflight gambling in Australia. Qantas wants the facility for international flights only.
The airline insists that a strict limit will apply, of probably around $350 for wins and losses.
But whether that limit will apply for each passenger, or just for each credit card, has not been decided. It will be difficult to police each passenger, who may be carrying four or five credit cards on board. and could run up sizable losses.
Concerns that passengers will lose their shirt have not been borne out by overseas experience.
Worldwide, the extent of inflight gambling has been limited, but passengers on Switzerland&apos;s Swissair have generated less money than the airline hoped for.
Not everyone is looking forward to in-flight gambling not the flight attendants who will have to police it, nor passengers sitting next to an inebriated blackjack player on a losing streak from Sydney to Singapore.
Flight attendants are already on the receiving end of increasing number of assaults and abuse, often fuelled by alcohol.
Some attendants are not thrilled at the prospect of explaining to an inebriated passenger, who has just lost $350 on video blackjack, that they cannot win their money back because they have reached their credit card limit.
Not every airline is embracing the concept either. Qantas, British Airways (which part-owns Qantas), Singapore Airlines and Swissair are all developing in-flight casinos.
But Ansett is not so sure, and yesterday said it kept an &quot;open file&quot; on the subject.
&quot;One of the problems with inflight gambling is that it is illegal,&quot; said Ansett spokesman Mr Peter Young - adding, however, that airlines including Qantas are confident they can sort that one out.
&quot;The bigger problem from our point of view is that starting up this sort of service has been the frightful, technical unreliability of the systems.&quot;

			<TEXT>AIR travellers will be able to gamble on international flights as part of a Qantas plan to invest $320 million on an interactive video service for its passengers.
Qantas executives said yesterday economy-class passengers would tap into a gaming facility and bet a dollar or two while flying overseas.
But they refused to disclose any details of the type of gambling.
Concerns on whether passengers would lose their entire holiday pay were dispelled by the company when Qantas group executive general manager (commercial) Geoff Dixon said controls would be undertaken to restrict bets.
When or where the gaming facility is introduced will rely on continuing discussions between Qantas management and the Federal Government.
But Mr Dixon said he was hopeful the Government would support the installation under the weight of other airlines introducing similar facilities.
He said the airline could have it up and running within 12 to 18 months.
Gaming is a vital component of a personalised interactive system involving video selections and computer games.
Mr Dixon said gaming could partly offset the costs of installing the interactive video service.
News of its proposed fitting was revealed during the Qantas launch of a $550 million Flying Towards 2000 campaign.
The massive program, involving extensive advertising and leading sporting identities, is for three years and covers &quot;the most far-reaching changes ever&quot; to the airline&apos;s product and services.
Qantas chief executive James Strong told a packed news conference the company&apos;s aim was to ensure Qantas remained a leader in world aviation until 2000 and beyond.
Australian sport champions golfer Greg Norman, 500cc motor cyclist Mick Doohan and &quot;The Woodies&quot; tennis doubles team are to appear in the advertising campaign coinciding with Flying Towards 2000.
Part of the $550 million investment includes the fitting of fully-reclining sleeper seats in international first-class, slimline seats with lumbar support in economy-class international flights and new seating in domestic aircraft.
Accompanying the reconfiguration of the fleet will be 350 flight attendants, to provide a more personalised first-class.
The airline has also appointed hotel customer service expert Ted Wright, formerly of the Regent Hotel, Sydney, and Australian chef Neil Perry, founder of the Rockpool restaurant group.
Qantas said two new 767 aircraft would be added, lifting the Qantas fleet to 99.

			<TEXT>NICHOLAS Heyward calls it the nail-biting phase: the 18 days that will determine whether the Brisbane Biennial Festival of Music ends the year, and indeed its life, in the black or in the red.
Heyward, chief executive officer of the Biennial, says by the time the classical musical feast opens tonight ticket sales will be not too far off the total $530,000 sold during the 1995 Biennial.
The two opening events - Gospel at the Symphony conducted by Isaiah Jackson and William Yang&apos;s The North - have already sold out, although other shows later in the festival are still wide open.
But despite the up-beat advance sales, Heyward is nervous. He still needs another $250,000 worth of tickets to be sold during the next 18 days for the Biennial to break even.
&quot;At the moment we have sold around 13,500 tickets and it looks as if we will be just under $500,000 when we open,&quot; Heyward says.
&quot;I don&apos;t know whether we&apos;ll exceed our predictions but we&apos;re well ahead of last year. It all depends on the box office now. This is a nervous time for any arts program; a number of arts companies have found their box office not as good as they had hoped, so we just have to wait and see. If the box office builds up, we will be fine; if not, then we won&apos;t be.&quot; Heyward attributes the rise in advance ticket sales to a broader program this year compared with 1995. Revolving around romanticism, the fourth and final Biennial will have more than 100 performances, including a concert performance of Korngold&apos;s opera Die tote Stadt, chamber music recitals of Schubert and Brahms, and soprano Mechthild Gessendorf singing Strauss.
Heyward concedes that the fact that this is the &quot;last hurrah&quot; for the Biennial could also have helped convince classical music lovers to book early.
Queensland&apos;s Borbidge Government announced last year that 1997 would see not only the fourth but the final Biennial Festival of Music, with the festival to be rolled into the more mainstream Brisbane Festival from next year.
While ticket pre-sales have been solid, Heyward says sponsorship has been disappointing.
Companies such as Qantas, Golden Casket, Conrad International and The Courier-Mail have contributed a combined $1 million in sponsorship dollars: Heyward was hoping for $1.25 million from the corporate coffers.
Two supporters of the Biennial since its inception, Suncorp and Bank of Queensland, pulled out this year amid rationalisation of the Queensland financial market. Heyward would not comment on rumours that some companies had been persuaded to save their money for next year&apos;s expanded Brisbane Festival.
&quot;It was difficult this year because we could only do sponsorship deals for one year, whereas previously we&apos;ve been able to talk about an ongoing relationship,&quot; Heyward says.
He insists he will not let melancholy about the Biennial&apos;s impending death get in the way of enjoying the next 21/2 weeks. But he is adamant there will be nothing quite like it once it is gone. &quot;Nowhere in Australia will they get this range of fine music again. At the moment we&apos;re really excited because the festival is beginning. We might get sad after it&apos;s finished, but we will not get sad at this end of things; it&apos;s just about to begin.&quot;
For Heyward personally, the end of the Biennial signifies the end of Brisbane. Soon after the Borbidge Government sounded the death knell for the Biennial, Heyward was snapped up as general manager of the Adelaide Festival.
He has been moving between Adelaide and Brisbane, and will permanently relocate to Adelaide almost immediately after the Biennial finishes. He will work on the 1998 and 2000 Adelaide festivals with artistic director Robyn Archer.

			<TEXT>QANTAS has rejected speculation of an Olympic ambush marketing attempt on the eve of the launch of its new $4 million corporate image campaign featuring some of Australia&apos;s best-known athletes.
Television advertising, which breaks at the end of next week, is believed to feature, among others, swimmer Kieren Perkins, basketballer Luc Longley, golfer Greg Norman, Australian rugby union captain John Eales and skier Kirsty Marshall.
A TV and cinema campaign beginning this week launches a new logo and theme for Qantas: &quot;Flying towards 2000&quot;. It will be supported by product-related commercials using motorcyclist Mick Doohan and tennis doubles players Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodford. All were created by M&amp;C Saatchi.
Industry sources have suggested the campaign had been created to ambush Ansett&apos;s official airline sponsorship status of the Sydney Olympics by moving from entertainers to athletes in its advertising.
Qantas group executive general manager commercial Mr Geoff Dixon said the advertising was developed well before the Olympic sponsorship announcement. He said: &quot;It has nothing to do with the Olympics. Some athletes like Greg Norman have been contracted to Qantas for 20 years, others for five to 10 years. (Of) virtually all the athletes in our advertising, half are long-term Qantas and others are new.&quot;
The marketing and advertising would have a strong sports theme, moving away from the &quot;I still call Australia home&quot; Australian entertainers campaign launched three years ago.
Ansett Olympic general manager Mr Glenn Robertson said the use of athletes in the Qantas campaign was a &quot;remarkable coincidence&quot;. &quot;It&apos;s funny, (Qantas) has no link with the Olympics and Olympic athletes - I find it a remarkable coincidence,&quot; he said.
&quot;The ambush proposition most people would clearly see. (Mr Dixon) says there is no link: I wonder what the people at SOCOG would think?&quot;
Mr Robertson said Ansett would launch its four-stage Olympic marketing program in about a month which would focus on linking the Olympic ideals and Ansett&apos;s staff.
Meanwhile, Ansett&apos;s Olympic marketing director, Ms Julie Smith, has resigned to pursue other interests. She will not be replaced.

			<TEXT>A $550 million re-launch of Qantas, announced yesterday, was &quot;fundamental to the competitive position&quot; of the airline, managing director Mr James Strong said.
But the airline does not know if the biggest part of the program - inflight systems in every seat, capable but not yet permitted to offer gambling - will be able to pay its way.
A TV advertising campaign, new logo, and new corporate theme of &quot;Flying towards 2000&quot; will back Qantas&apos; immediate changes to in-flight service and catering, and longer-term plans to fit out its fleet of 99 aircraft with new seating, as well as personal in-flight entertainment systems on international aircraft.
The $550 million cost is well over the $430 million flagged in Qantas&apos; annual report.
Qantas commercial manager Mr Geoff Dixon said the refurbishment program had expanded from inflight entertainment and premium-class seating to include new seating in all classes on both domestic and international routes.
Qantas is lobbying the Federal Government for approval to offer limited gambling on international flights, using an in-flight entertainment system that would cost $320 million.
Mr Dixon said the potential revenue from gambling was not included in business forecasts used when considering the in-flight entertainment installation.
&quot;It&apos;s something that we need to offset this investment and we believe we have to make this investment ... for competitive reasons,&quot; he said.
Mr Strong said the airline had deferred the installation of in-flight videos, because of numerous problems experienced by other airlines.
Those problems had not yet been completely solved, he said, but added that &quot;no-one can be 100 per cent satisfied with any video system in any aircraft&quot;. Qantas is likely to decide within the next week on a proposal to buy 50 per cent of the Jetset travel group.
Qantas shares closed at a new high yesterday of $2.77, up 3c.
l The International Air Services Commission granted new capacity to Qantas on routes to London, increasing weekly flights from 14 Boeing 747s to 21 by April 1999.
The IASC also approved code-sharing plans for Qantas on British Airways flights from London to Paris and Austria, and for Ansett International and Air New Zealand to Seoul from Brisbane.

			<TEXT>QANTAS will spend more than half a billion dollars during the next three years on its most expensive facelift, overhauling everything from in-flight service to seating and a new logo, as well as installing a new $320 million video system.
But the airline does not know whether the Federal Government will allow in-flight gambling on the personal video systems to be installed in every seat for international passengers.
Qantas has asked the federal and State governments to allow gambling on international flights to and from Australia, because other international airlines, such as Singapore Airlines, are likely to offer in-flight casinos shortly.
The managing director of Qantas, Mr James Strong, said yesterday in-flight gambling was one of the few ways the airline could earn extra money to help pay for the investment in new video equipment.
However, Qantas commercial manager Mr Geoff Dixon said talks with governments had failed to resolve whether gambling would be allowed.
&quot;The best we can say is talks are continuing ... there is a good dialogue but nothing has been resolved,&quot; Mr Dixon said.
He said Qantas would argue that overseas airlines will grab Qantas&apos;s business if they can offer gambling when Australian airlines cannot.
&quot;It is an emotive issue but we are confident we can discuss something through with the Federal Government ... our concern is that we will not be able to offer this service when our competitors can. For our bottom line, we do need gambling.&quot;
For several months Qantas has debated whether to install personal videos on its international aircraft. The in-flight entertainment systems, which offer up to 20 movie and news channels, duty-free shopping and electronic games, are already a common feature on rivals, including Singapore Airlines.
But the video systems have been troublesome. Last year Singapore Airlines stopped advertising the personal videos because of the high rate of breakdowns and vandalism, which led to complaints from disappointed passengers.
As well as the $320 million investment in video systems, Qantas will redesign interiors on all domestic and international aircraft, including new seating for the 99 Qantas planes.
The airline is taking out a patent for its new first-class international cabins, which will include seats that convert to single beds.
The cabin refit will begin in October for domestic aircraft and April next year for international aircraft and the personal video systems are not likely to be installed for at least another year. Changes to service, menus and a new advertising campaign will begin this month.

			<TEXT>A PILOT who lost his job at Qantas when he turned 60 is taking his complaint against the airline to the United Nations.
Lawyer Nick Steyant-Browne said his company would ask the UN Committee on Human Rights to intervene on behalf of Peter Ivanoff, 67, of Melbourne.
Mr Ivanoff won his case against Qantas in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission last October, when the airline was ordered to reinstate and pay him $120,000 compensation.
Mr Steyant-Browne said Qantas ignored the ruling and the commission lacked the legal power to enforce its orders.
&quot;We&apos;ll be approaching the Human Rights Committee of the UN to seek to lobby for the UN to intervene on a persuasive basis to get Qantas to abide by the ruling of the commission,&quot; he said.

			<TEXT>QANTAS has agreed to set up a steering committee with unions to discuss contracting out customer service and ramp handling functions at three privatised airports.
The decision came after an order by the Industrial Relations Commission yesterday averted possible strike action over the plan.
The airline has also brought forward plans to advertise for potential tenderers for services at Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth airports, calling for expressions of interest in newspaper advertisements today.
The Australian Services Union had called on Qantas to drop the advertisements as a &quot;sign of good faith&quot;, but the airline rejected the request.
Unions yesterday agreed to suspend industrial action until Qantas and unions report back to the Commission on June 10.
The airline is reviewing all areas of operations and has already contracted some areas, including some engineering functions.
Qantas managing director Mr James Strong is due to make a statement today on the airline&apos;s future strategy.
A Qantas spokesman yesterday would not comment on reports that the announcement could include changes to the airline&apos;s senior management structure, as well as a new marketing campaign.

			<TEXT>SEVEN years after Australian Airlines sacked Peter Ivanoff for being too old, he is working on Melbourne building sites, still hoping that one day the airline will have to answer for its decision.
Mr Ivanoff plans to take his case against the airlines&apos; successor, Qantas, to the United Nations in New York in July.
Last year, the airline ignored a Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission ruling that recommended the former pilot be reinstated and paid compensation.
Mr Ivanoff said yesterday: &quot;We believe Qantas is thumbing its nose at a properly constituted body like the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission ... and these recommendations should be as good as law.&quot;
Between 1990 and 1992, Mr Ivanoff and three other Australian Airlines pilots were sacked after turning 60 - a standard Qantas safety policy at the time.
The pilots complained to the HREOC that they had been sacked on the basis of their age despite being fit and holding the appropriate licences to fly.
Last year, the HREOC ruled that Qantas&apos;s policy of retiring pilots when they turned 60 was discriminatory and recommended that the men be re-employed and compensated but, because the HREOC holds no coercive powers, Qantas was able to ignore the ruling.
Although the airline was later forced to scrap its policy, the four are still out in the cold.

			<TEXT>SACKED Qantas apprentices handed in their uniforms yesterday, and prepared to join the dole queues.
The 53 aircraft maintenance apprentices arrived at the Qantas jet base at Mascot for the last time at 8am.
Spokesman Wayne Redman said many of the men and women did not know what they would be doing following the sackings.
&quot;We are out there trying to find jobs, but in the aircraft industry at the moment that is not easy,&quot; he said.
The apprentices had just completed four years working for Qantas and had believed their future was secure.
Mr Redman said Qantas had told them they would be placed on an internal job mailing list.
Fellow worker Steve Setz said he had made inquiries at other airlines but things did not look hopeful.
He said smaller airlines might be the only option after it was announced on Thursday that Ansett would not be taking on extra staff.
&quot;I wanted to stay with Qantas, and definitely in the industry if possible,&quot; he said.
&quot;However, in the past two weeks since Qantas told us there have been very few jobs.&quot;

			<TEXT>A SIGNIFICANT new airline partnership was scheduled to come into being in Frankfurt yesterday in an alliance of five of the biggest airlines in Europe, Asia and North America - a group that Ansett Australia may also join.
As part of its strategy in the cutthroat competition for global markets, Germany&apos;s national carrier, Lufthansa, was set to announce the formation of &quot;Star Alliance&quot;. Mr Juergen Weber, chairman of the board of directors, said through its partnership with United Airlines, Thai Airways, Air Canada and the Scandinavian SAS airline, Lufthansa expected a &quot;clear improvement&quot; in its profits this year.
The alliance is intended to compete with one set up by British Airways-American Airlines and Qantas. Lufthansa is also still looking for at least one more partner in Asia.
&quot;We hope to take a decision this year,&quot; Mr Weber said but he did not specify which airlines were potential partners.
Lufthansa is already aligned to Ansett through frequent-flier programs and Ansett&apos;s Olympics program.
The two airlines have held talks for some months on more links.
Ansett also hopes to sign a codeshare deal with United shortly and is holding talks with Singapore Airlines, which could also join Lufthansa&apos;s Star Alliance.
Last year, Lufthansa showed an operating profit of 686 million German marks ($521 million), a decline of 9.3 per cent on 1995.
Its net profit was Dm558 million compared with Dm1.476 billion in 1995, the 1996 annual report said.
In Europe, Lufthansa is associated with British Midland airline.

			<TEXT>THE Government will reap a windfall of at least $9.8 billion from a range of privatisations this year in the largest ever selloff of public assets.
The centrepiece of the privatisation regime is the Government&apos;s one-third sale of Telstra, an election commitment which was announced in last year&apos;s Budget and will be offered to shareholders later this year.
Also up for sale in the next Budget year are a string of 57 publicly owned buildings, including the Government&apos;s new $160 million Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade site in Canberra.
The property sales, which span the nation, will net at least $800 million in 1997/98.
The overall privatisation figure for the next financial year, which drops to $5 billion in 1998/99, is conservative as it doesn&apos;t include the several billion dollars expected for the Government&apos;s sell-off of mobile phone and data communications frequencies, as well as other parts of the &quot;spectrum&quot;. However, the revenue from sales in forward years will decline dramatically with all the big-ticket items, such as Telstra, Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank and the airport privatisations, no longer up for grabs.
The Telstra sale and the airport privatisations will form the bulk of the $9.83 billion expected to flow to the Commonwealth in this Budget.
The first phase of the airports sale will deliver $3.3 billion to the Government&apos;s coffers.
The Budget papers show that revenue from asset sales will fall from $5 billion in 1998/99 to just $10 million in the 1999/2000 financial year.
By that stage the Commonwealth would have sold more than $20 billion in public assets since 1993/94.
The second tranche of airport sales is expected to deliver about $2.5 billion to the Government&apos;s coffers.
The sale of Australian Industry Development Corporation and a number of businesses and other assets of the Department of Administrative Services, such as the Commonwealth car fleet, are expected to finalised in the next year.
Among the other assets included in this Budget, however, are the leases of Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth airports as well as the sale of Australian National and National Rail.
The Government also announced yesterday it hoped to sell Auscript, the Australian Multimedia Enterprises, the National Transmission Network and the Australian Defence Industries.
The Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Jull, said yesterday the Government&apos;s plan to sell the range of Commonwealth properties was justified because there was &quot;no compelling reason&quot; to continue with their ownership.
As part of Mr Jull&apos;s divestment strategy, the 14 higher-valued buildings will be grouped into six packages, with four packages sold in the coming financial year and the rest in the following year.
Another set of 15 Commonwealth properties, mostly in Canberra, could be put on the block in future with the Government keen to retain four key buildings in the capital on national interest and heritage grounds.

			<TEXT>THE Middle East was once just a fuel stop for Australian air passengers travelling onto Europe and hoping to get out of Bahrain or Dubai as quickly as possible.
The introduction of long-range aircraft to airline fleets in the early 1980s removed the need for even that passing visit.
Only in recent years have airlines, both Australian and international, considered that enough travellers might actually want to get off the plane to justify direct services to the Middle East.
But the market remains small and competitive, with an oversupply of capacity that means Australian carriers Qantas Airways and Ansett International are unlikely to operate flights in their own right to the region for some time, if ever.
Qantas pulled out of the region in 1990, after the Gulf War made flights to Europe via the Middle East and India impracticable.
Since late last year, Qantas has been discussing a code-share agreement with Emirates for the latter&apos;s three weekly flights between Melbourne and Dubai.
But the discussions are apparently taking longer than anticipated and no start date has yet been set for the agreement.
Ansett International has squashed rumours that it is seeking a code-share arrangement with Kuwait Airways, and will instead keep its attention squarely on Asia.
Kuwait Airways earlier this year was reported to be commencing flights to Melbourne but has not done so and has no immediate intention to begin. It does have rights to fly between Australia and Kuwait, but a Kuwait Airways spokeswoman said the route was &quot;just too competitive&quot; at the moment to justify another carrier.
The competition includes Emirates, with its three flights to Melbourne from Dubai; Gulf Air, which flies four times weekly from Bahrain to Sydney and Melbourne; Egyptair, operating two weekly flights to Cairo; and Middle East Airlines, which operates one weekly service from Sydney to Beirut.
Increasingly, the carriers are marketing their services as not only an alternative route to Europe but as destinations in their own right.
Emirates, which began three weekly flights into Melbourne last year, recently switched from using Airbus 310 and 300 aircraft to Boeing&apos;s new stretch 777-200 aircraft.
The 777 increases Emirates&apos; passenger capacity by more than 70 per cent and doubles cargo capacity.
No Middle Eastern city yet ranks as a major destination for Australian air travellers, although the airlines are doing their best to market Dubai, in particular.
Department of Transport figures for late last year show Emirates, Egyptair, Middle East and Gulf Air accounted for less than 1 per cent of both passenger and freight traffic to and from Australia. That equates to about 9000 passengers and 400 tonnes of cargo a month.
Gulf Air is grappling with attempts to return to profitability, after a loss of more than $US150 million in 1995.

			<TEXT>THE risk of a strike grounding Qantas eased yesterday when management offered its 53 dismissed apprentices $3000 each and promised to help them find work.
Qantas chief executive James Strong said the payment was &quot;based on the very unusual circumstances and would not apply in other cases&quot;. The apprentices were told last Thursday there were no permanent positions for them. They were given two weeks&apos; pay in lieu of notice.
On Tuesday the company announced a further purge of 132 other jobs in its engineering and maintenance division.
Mr Strong said Qantas had written to the apprentices saying the company would provide job search and financial counselling assistance, and give them &quot;priority&quot; for future employment.
A Qantas spokesman said last night nine organisations had so far offered the apprentices jobs.

			<TEXT>QANTAS has offered 53 sacked apprentices a $3000 payment and priority for any vacancies at the airline in a concession which managing director Mr James Strong said yesterday would not be repeated for other dismissed workers.
But the offer has created a split among unions representing the apprentices in the avionics and engineering fields.
The Australian Workers Union has accepted the offer to the annoyance of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, which represents more apprentices.
The NSW secretary of the AMWU, Mr Paul Bastian, said a meeting with the workers today would determine whether to push for a better offer.
A letter sent to the 53 apprentices, which detailed the payment, also named nine companies that had contacted Qantas about employing the former employees, including the Department of Defence and smaller companies, but not rival airline Ansett Australia.
&quot;Qantas told (apprentices) it would provide Job Search and financial counselling assistance, together with priority in future employment at the airline based on the normal Qantas selection procedures,&quot; Mr Strong said in a statement.
A mass meeting of Qantas workers will be held today to discuss their response if the company moves to cut more jobs. Mr Strong has said Qantas cannot rule out further job losses.

			<TEXT>QANTAS has set a surprising aviation record in United States by becoming the busiest foreign airline operating out of Los Angeles International Airport.
Figures released yesterday showed Qantas carried 319,047 passengers through the Los Angeles airport in 1996.
The only foreign airline to carry more passengers through the airport was Mexicana Airlines (458,794 passengers), which is essentially a domestic carrier because it is close to Mexico and California and its high number of short-haul flights.

			<TEXT>QANTAS will purge another 132 staff in its engineering and maintenance division in Sydney by July, management told unions yesterday.
Unions immediately said they will consider industrial action over the retrenchments, which come after the airline told an entire class of fourth-year apprentices that they would not have jobs after they completed their indentures.
According to documents obtained by The Daily Telegraph, Qantas will axe six executives, 37 support staff and 89 people in engineering and support departments.
Last week 53 apprentices who were a fortnight away from completing their qualifications were told there was no full-time work for them.
Sources said that in a private four-hour meeting between unions and Qantas management yesterday, management said the cuts would be made by July 1.
Qantas chief executive James Strong said the reductions were &quot;unavoidable&quot; if the airline were to &quot;remain viable in an increasingly competitive aviation market&quot;. Mr Strong blamed low staff attrition rates and the Government policy that allowed more competitors in the nation&apos;s skies.
Mr Strong said Qantas&apos;s manpower costs were 25 per cent higher than its major competitors.
The NSW secretary-elect of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union Paul Bastian yesterday accused the company of &quot;breaking the enterprise agreement&quot;. &quot;There is a provision in the agreement that says redundancies should not occur until all avenues have been exhausted to try and minimise the redundancies,&quot; Mr Bastian said.
Mr Bastian said one of the major reasons the company gave for the redundancies was the impact of the Government&apos;s open skies policy which placed &quot;no limit on the amount of carriers that can come in&quot;. &quot;This is the second time in a week this excuse has been run - the first being by BHP management.
&quot;If government policy allows the exporting of jobs overseas, then it&apos;s time we started to review government policy.&quot;
Mr Bastian said the union would consider the management briefing and would await the outcome of a hearing over the 53 apprentices in the Industrial Relations Commission on Thursday.
All unions representing Qantas workers would then hold a mass meeting on Friday to decide their next move.
Mr Strong yesterday denied reports that the 53 apprentices were sacked before they ended their indentures.
He said Qantas instead would not be offering the apprentices full-time employment after they completed their indentures and become qualified.

			<TEXT>QANTAS could not rule out further job losses in order to keep the airline viable, managing director Mr James Strong said yesterday after the company announced another 132 workers would be dismissed.
Unions slammed the company for failing to consult over the new job losses and the removal of 53 apprentices last week. They would not rule out industrial action if the company failed to review its position.
At a meeting with management yesterday, unions asked the company to put an end to rumours that thousands of jobs might be at risk after comments by Mr Strong that labour costs needed to be cut by 20 per cent.
After the meeting, Mr Strong said further job losses could be expected as Qantas reviewed every area of operation.
&quot;We have two choices. One is to pretend that nothing has changed ... or in a very methodical way, to go about improving in every way we can. We regret (the job losses) obviously, but there is no easy alternative,&quot; he said.
&quot;What we have tried to explain to people is that we are systematically going through our whole business, and we are trying to do that on a logical basis rather than (incurring) mass reductions, which are not targeted and specific ... that sort of thing will continue area by area, very specifically with great care.&quot;
All 185 job cuts announced in the past week have been in the maintenance and engineering sections. About 1000 forms asking for expressions of interest in redundancy were handed out to Qantas&apos;s 5000 blue-collar workers yesterday.
Unions want the company to ask for general expressions of interest and to allow apprentices to be &quot;swapped&quot; for other workers if they get more volunteers than needed.
Mr Strong denied union claims the job cuts could affect Qantas&apos;s safety reputation.
&quot;Our aim is to ensure that we do not impact on our capabilities, in terms of safety and operating strengths ... we are doing this very carefully.&quot;
He said public reaction to the job cuts had taken on an &quot;exaggerated tone&quot;, and said the airline was continuing to increase staff in a number of areas. Qantas has almost 30,000 staff.
Union officials said they understood the company needed to make changes as a result of the move from a government-owned airline in a protected market to a privately owned airline facing greater competition.
But the State secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, Mr Paul Bastian, said the approach served only to destroy morale.
&quot;It is the position of every union around the table that we would be doing everything we can to protect jobs and that includes the apprentices,&quot; he said.
Airlines&apos; organiser with the Australian Workers Union, Mr Nick Allen, said after the BHP announcement of job cuts that the Federal Government needed to re-examine industry policies to stem a growing tide of redundancies.
l Email is preparing to go to the Victorian Supreme Court seeking an injunction to end a four-week strike and picket line at its Martin Bright Steels operation, which is affecting supplies to all four car manufacturers.

			<TEXT>QANTAS is expected to sack another 200 or so workers when management meets representatives of maintenance staff today.
The airline is holding talks with the Engineering and Maintenance Federation of Unions and redundancies are understood to be on the agenda.
&quot;We are meeting with the relevant unions to discuss a range of issues,&quot; a Qantas spokesman said.
He refused to confirm staff cutbacks, although it is believed up to 200 jobs are at risk.
Australian Workers Union vice-president Arthur Harper said he was expecting between 150 and 200 redundancies from Qantas&apos; maintenance division.
Catering, airport operations and information technology have also been targeted for possible cutbacks by Qantas management, it is believed.
The staff cuts would amount to about 3 per cent of the entire division, Mr Harper said.
Qantas industrial relations general manager Peter Marsh confirmed the company would be advising the unions on redundancies generally at the meeting.
Mr Harper said there were reports Qantas was moving maintenance services to Asia.
Last week, Qantas left 53 apprentices without jobs when they were told they would not be employed by the company after they had finished their trade education.
Mr Harper told an Industrial Relations Commission hearing yesterday that he believed the apprentices were sacked because Qantas did not have to pay them redundancies.
Mr Marsh told the hearing the decision to sack the apprentices when they finished training on May 16 was not taken lightly.
And Qantas general manager James Strong defended the company&apos;s trainee intake, saying Qantas was one of the biggest employers of apprentices in Australia - with around 500 at present.
He dismissed suggestions by unions that the airline was using the apprentices as a form of &quot;cheap labour&quot;. &quot;That is a silly statement because these people are being trained for a career,&quot; he said.
&quot;And it&apos;s a tremendous accomplishment for them to have these qualifications.
&quot;We have certainly indicated that we&apos;re prepared to talk to the apprentices about trying to help them to find jobs.&quot;

			<TEXT>QANTAS chief executive James Strong last night defended the decision to sack 53 apprentices from the airline, saying it was not an unusual move.
&quot;In our catering area, where we employ perhaps 40 to 50 apprentices, it is our normal policy that they are not employed by Qantas at the end of their apprenticeship,&quot; Mr Strong told the ABC&apos;s 7.30 Report program.
&quot;It is our contribution to the catering industry.
&quot;There are many firms in Australia who as a general rule do not keep apprentices on.&quot; Mr Strong said the company was one of the biggest employers of apprentices in Australia, with around 500 at present.
He dismissed suggestions by unions that the airline was using the apprentices as a form of &quot;cheap labour&quot;. The 53 apprentices were sacked last Thursday and more job losses are expected.

			<TEXT>THESE 12 young apprentices, sacked by Qantas without warning just two weeks before they completed their indentures, could be the first casualties of a campaign of mass redundancies at the airline, it was claimed yesterday.
At 2pm last Thursday, 53 Qantas apprentices were called by management to a meeting, sacked, and escorted from the jet base by security guards after being stripped of their passes.
Yesterday, their faces still expressed their confusion, anger and despair as unions claimed more Qantas employees could be feeling the same emotions, with more job losses expected.
At yesterday&apos;s May Day march in Sydney, mention of the name Qantas brought boos and hisses.
When the 12 took the stage in Circular Quay after the May Day march along George St, a crowd of 2000 people called out their support for the apprentices.
Australian Manufacturing Workers Union State secretary Paul Bastian said the airline was rife with rumours that up to 4000 workers could lose their jobs.
And as many as 200 could be sacked today, he claimed.
A Qantas spokesman described the figure as &quot;alarmist&quot; yesterday, but confirmed industrial issues would be discussed in a meeting with union officials on Tuesday.
A joint meeting of all airline unions representing Qantas staff will be held on Wednesday.
&quot;We will be pushing for any action we can to get some justice for these people,&quot; Mr Bastian said.
&quot;Up until a few weeks ago their supervisors were telling them things would be okay.&quot;
He said union representatives were barred from the meeting at which the apprentices were told their fate, and the airline refused to answer any workers&apos; queries.
The mass sacking of apprentices was delivered as a fait accompli, and in a stroke wiped out careers of young men, he said.
The 53 apprentices are taking their case to the Industrial Commission today, where the union will mount a class action on their behalf claiming unfair dismissal.
One of the sacked apprentices, 38-year-old Wayne Redman, had only just been asked to represent the airline in the NSW Apprentice of the Year awards.
Some, like Mr Redman, were planning to get married soon.
Pablo Belarra, 24, married four months ago and has a $200,000 mortgage to pay off.
&quot;I cannot express how angry I am,&quot; Mr Redman said.
Another said: &quot;I felt like a criminal after being escorted out by security&quot;.

			<TEXT>QANTAS workers are bracing for further sackings next week following the dismissal of 53 apprentices from the airline&apos;s Sydney operations on Thursday.
A meeting between management and blue-collar unions has been called for Tuesday to discuss &quot;a range of industrial issues&quot; with union officials believing at least 100 further jobs could be cut.
A spokesman for Qantas said yesterday that the rumours of large job cuts which had been circulating for months were &quot;in the realms of fantasy and misinformation&quot;. The NSW secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, Mr Paul Bastian, said the sudden dismissal of the apprentices had raised fears more cuts were on the way.
Qantas has been conducting a cost-saving program where departments put in tenders as a test of their competitiveness.
The airline has advertised tenders for the engineering section as part of the process, and Cathay Pacific has already picked up some of the catering work.
In a memo to staff last November, the managing director, Mr James Strong, warned that cutting would &quot;inevitably result in some redundancies and changes for people at all levels of the company&quot;. Qantas yesterday defended the dismissal of the 53 apprentices, saying the company was following common industry practices.
A spokesman said all apprentices understood that there were no guarantees of employment at the end of their training and there were no longer positions available.
He said there were still plans to take on 41 new first-year apprentices later this year.
&quot;So, we are still committed to it but what we have seen is a change in being able to take on employment of the apprentices,&quot; he said.
&quot;We would like to be able to keep them but we can&apos;t because the requirement is not there as it has been in previous years.&quot; But one of the apprentices who was dismissed, Mr Augusto Crupi, 25, said the company had indicated to him three months ago that he would be employed when his training ended on May 16.
He said he was disgusted at the airline&apos;s behaviour and was worried he would not be able to find another job because of the specialised nature of his skills. &quot;We reckon it&apos;s just pathetic, it&apos;s a coward act,&quot; he said.
&quot;They train you and everything, tell you you have got a job and then push you out.&quot;
Mr Bastian said some of the apprentices dismissed had won awards for their work, while one man had been Apprentice of the Year for the past three years.
&quot;The company seems to be taking the cheap way out,&quot; he said.
The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Dr Kemp, said the Federal Government would try to find work for the 53 apprentices.

&quot;Coming just a few days after BHP it doesn&apos;t say much about Australian corporate citizenship,&quot; Australian Manufacturers Workers Union NSW secretary-elect, Paul Bastian, said.

			<TEXT>QANTAS has been accused of treating its workers like &quot;human garbage&quot; after sacking 53 apprentices yesterday.
And the apprentice&apos;s union last night threatened to cripple the airline if the jobs were not restored.
The young trainees - who were about to complete four years of skilled training in avionics and engineering were told they were &quot;surplus&quot;, made to hand over their work IDs and escorted by security off the Qantas base.
In lieu of notice they were given cheques for two weeks&apos; pay.
In a letter to the sacked workers, obtained by The Daily Telegraph, general manager of engineering services Barry Pulbrook said the move was necessary to &quot;cut costs&quot;. &quot;I regret to advise you that Qantas is not able to offer you ongoing employment following the completion of your indenture,&quot; Mr Pulbrook&apos;s letter says.
&quot;As you would appreciate, this has been a very difficult decision for the company.&quot;
The letter says the sackings were necessary because of &quot;changing requirements in the company&apos;s operational flying program, low staff attrition rates and the need to improve business and cost efficiency&quot;. Yesterday the apprentices were drowning their sorrows at a nearby hotel, still wearing their work overalls.
One apprentice, who declined to be named, said he was &quot;devastated&quot;. &quot;The way we have been treated is outrageous,&quot; he said.
&quot;Included in the group were many of Qantas&apos;s top 10 apprentices and the company&apos;s top apprentice.&quot;
The apprentices will picket the Qantas jet base today and Australian Manufacturing Workers Union NSW secretary-elect Paul Bastian said the union would do &quot;everything we can to get their jobs back&quot;. &quot;That will include industrial action,&quot; he said.
Mr Bastian said that if the union&apos;s 900 members working at Qantas went on strike, it would severely affect the maintenance of aircraft.
&quot;It was one of the most humiliating circumstances possible for these young people. They were ... just thrown out like human garbage,&quot; he said.
A spokesman for Qantas said the airline had &quot;had no permanent positions available&quot; but was still employing 417 apprentices.

In a letter to the sacked workers, obtained by The Daily Telegraph, the general manager of engineering services, Barry Pulbrook, said the move was necessary to &quot;cut costs&quot;. &quot;I regret to advise you that Qantas is not able to offer you ongoing employment following the completion of your indenture,&quot; Mr Pulbrook&apos;s letter says.
&quot;As you would appreciate, this has been a very difficult decision for the company.&quot;
The letter says the sackings were necessary because of &quot;changing requirements in the company&apos;s operational flying program, low staff attrition rates and the need to improve business and cost efficiency&quot;. Yesterday the apprentices were drowning their sorrows at a nearby hotel, still wearing their work overalls.
One apprentice, who declined to be named, said he was &quot;devastated&quot;. &quot;The way we have been treated is outrageous. Included in the group were many of Qantas&apos;s top 10 apprentices and the company&apos;s top apprentice.&quot; The apprentices will picket the Qantas jet base today and Australian Manufacturing Workers Union NSW secretary-elect Paul Bastian said the union would do &quot;everything we can to get their jobs back&quot;. &quot;That will include industrial action,&quot; he said.
Mr Bastian said that if the AMWU&apos;s 900 members working at Qantas went on strike, it would severely affect the maintenance of aircraft.
&quot;It was one of the most humiliating circumstances possible for these young people. They were ... just thrown out like human garbage,&quot; he said.
A spokesman for Qantas said the airline had &quot;had no permanent positions available&quot; but was still employing 417 apprentices.

			<TEXT>THE Federal Government has announced a policy overhaul favouring new entrants and airlines which use their own aircraft on overseas routes rather than code-sharing with other carriers.
The new guidelines, announced yesterday by the Minister for Transport, Mr Sharp, expand the power of the International Air Services Commission and will have far-reaching implications for both Qantas Airways Ltd and Ansett International.
Under new rules for the allocation of international air rights, Australian airlines planning new overseas routes which use their own aircraft for the entire trip will be given precedence over airlines using code-share arrangements.
New airlines - for both passengers and freight - will also be given first priority over existing overseas carriers, including Qantas and Ansett, when applying for international rights.
Although no big international airlines have started in recent years, a crop of small operators have applied to the IASC to begin passenger flights. Earlier this week the IASC published a determination granting Australia World Airways, a Melbourne-based company, capacity to Sri Lanka, The Netherlands and Greece.
The policy statement says airlines operating international routes using their own aircraft will create more &quot;competition benefits&quot; in the longer-term than routes operated on a code-share basis.
Code-sharing is an arrangement where one airline markets and sells tickets on another airline&apos;s flights. The practice allows airlines to claim more extensive overseas route networks, without big investments in new staff or aircraft.
Airlines can only fly to overseas destinations using capacity negotiated between governments in bilateral agreements. The IASC, an independent statutory authority established in 1992, allocates those rights to Australian airlines.
Before the IASC was established, Qantas was Australia&apos;s only designated international carrier and automatically entitled to all capacity negotiated by the Government.
Yesterday Mr Sharp said the moves were the &quot;first major reforms&quot; to the IASC since its inception.
Both Qantas and Ansett are expanding their international links using a combination of code-share agreements and their own aircraft.
The expanded IASC policy could work against Ansett which, with a smaller fleet and fewer resources, is more likely to use code-share arrangements to extend its international network. Qantas&apos; code-share routes include a recent alliance with Japan Airlines, while Ansett is operating an extensive code-share agreement with equity partner Air New Zealand on trans-Tasman flights.
The aggressive Australia-New Zealand market - the biggest international route from Australia - could be the first testing ground for the IASC&apos;s new priorities. But Ansett&apos;s number one target for overseas expansion, the Hong Kong route on which it wants to lift flights from five times weekly to daily, is not likely to be affected because the airline proposes to operate its own services.
Ansett also hopes to seal an alliance with Singapore Airlines, which could include code-share flights to Europe.
When granting overseas rights to airlines, the IASC must consider not only competition benefits but also issues of trade and tourism benefits, and the financial and business capability of an airline to use any rights granted.
Yesterday&apos;s policy statement also determined that competition policy issues for airlines ultimately rest with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and not the IASC.
But the IASC&apos;s powers will be expanded further to allocate capacity to freight airlines operating overseas, and granting &quot;fifth freedom&quot; or beyond rights to airlines.
Beyond rights have been a sticking point in recent bilateral talks between Australia and New Zealand, with Air NZ hoping to win more beyond rights - or the right to pick up passengers in a second country and take them to a third destination - through Australia.

			<TEXT>A GENERATION of senior executives is getting its first look at benefits of the new world of computer communication, via an Internet terminal at the Sydney Airport Expo.
The expo, in the Qantas domestic terminal, offers first-hand Internet experience for business people largely unfamiliar with high-technology.
&quot;I think it&apos;s a very valuable marketing exercise,&quot; said Mr Michael Komoroski, the marketing vice-president for OzEmail, which contributed a live Internet terminal to the Airport Expo.
&quot;Many of those using it are businesspeople who have read and heard about the Internet and intranets, and who welcome the chance to get a real handson experience that our terminal offers.
&quot;There&apos;s not a whole lot of things to do in airport lounges.&quot;
Airport Expo, sponsored by The Australian, displays new technology from 15 vendors with the assistance of staff trained by the organiser, Original Ventures (Pacific).
&quot;In our part of Expo, the businesspeople are a mixture of experienced Web surfers and visitors taking their first look, and asking staff to show them how this Internet thing works,&quot; Mr Komoroski said.
&quot;Staff are well-trained and can respond to most inquiries and the visitors can take away a free floppy disk or CDROM to establish Internet access through us.&quot;
Of course, access to the OzEmail terminal is easiest outside morning and afternoon peak air travel hours.
OzEmail&apos;s participation was based on similar expos in US airports and so far, Mr Komoroski said, it was making the impact suggested by the US results.
&quot;Supplying Internet access is a lucrative business for us,&quot; he said. &quot;We have received many contacts, which our marketing staff are following up.
&quot;Our salespeople are receiving good levels of response to their follow-ups on the contacts Airport Expo offers, and I know that our partners at Expo are having the same experience.&quot;

			<TEXT>ANSETT was warned yesterday by the peak travel agents lobby group that more than 90 per cent of its members would choose to sell Qantas air travel if Ansett goes ahead with plans to cut travel agent commissions by 20 per cent from May 1.
The Australian Federation of Travel Agents&apos; chief executive, Ms Susan Lenehan, said: &quot;There is no doubt we are facing a do or die situation.
&quot;If Ansett persists with the cuts, and Qantas takes similar action, we will see massive layoffs and flow-on damage to Australian tourism, as agents turn to selling offshore holidays at the expense of local holidays to maintain their revenue flow.&quot; The federation has called a &quot;crisis meeting&quot; of members for May 31 and has cancelled its annual overseas conference in September to concentrate on the distribution costs issue.
Overseas holidays and airfares earn a higher commission rate for agents than local travel.
Last month, Ansett said it would cut commission rates from 10 per cent to 8 per cent for overseas travel and 5 per cent to 4 per cent for domestic travel from May 1.
But Qantas has not yet followed suit, although the airline is also reviewing distribution costs and has issued a range of undisclosed proposals to the federation, which it&apos;s still considering.
A survey released yesterday of 1000 AFTA members, from a membership base of 3700 travel agents, says 91 per cent of agencies would choose to sell Qantas over Ansett tickets if the latter airline cuts commissions. It also says 45 per cent of travel agents will consider retrenching staff or reducing work hours, if revenue from fee income drops.
&quot;It is extremely alarming for tourism, jobs growth and you would have to say, for Ansett itself,&quot; Ms Lenehan said.
The lower commission rates could save Ansett about $15 million a year in agency payments, making a substantial contribution to the airline&apos;s cost-cutting target of $150 million. But the mooted savings assume that revenue levels remain steady.
Ms Lenehan said travel agents still wrote about half of both airlines&apos; business and could not be ignored.
&quot;We are not Luddites ... we understand that Ansett has financial problems but we are saying this is not the best way to solve them,&quot; she said.
Yesterday, Ansett public affairs manager Mr Peter Young said the airline&apos;s position on cutting commissions was &quot;unchanged&quot;, despite federation calls to review the decision.
&quot;It was a very, very difficult decision to make but things simply got to the stage where we could no longer ignore the fact that distribution costs had risen so much since 1990,&quot; he said.

			<TEXT>QANTAS faces a $120,000 compensation payout to passengers whose luggage was contaminated by spilt jet fuel in an accident at Sydney Airport two weeks ago.
The airline is offering passengers about $1000 a bag and has not returned any of the damaged luggage.
But the final amount may be much higher, with some passengers preparing to sue for the correct value of their property.
A Federal Airports Corporation spokesman said an independent investigation had been launched into the accident.
A spokesman for Qantas said about 120 bags were affected when three containers carrying as many as 100 bags each were sprayed with fuel.
About 10,000 litres of aviation fuel was spilt when a baggage trolley sliced apart a hose on March 29.
The fuel was spread over a 500sq m area around the aircraft, forcing the evacuation of more than 300 people from the international terminal and the Qantas captains&apos; lounge.
Seven firefighters and two trucks were immediately dispatched from the FAC&apos;s rescue and firefighting service headquarters at the airport.
Qantas will not reveal how many passengers were affected but it is believed the bags were so badly damaged they were never returned and have since been destroyed.
The airline&apos;s compensation policy involves paying passengers varying amounts, depending on the weight of their luggage.
There is no provision to compensate for valuable items.
&quot;The airline is meeting legitimate expenses of passengers whose baggage was affected and assisting claims for compensation,&quot; the Qantas spokesman said.
One passenger, semipro golfer Keith Steven, lost his golf clubs worth $2500 and other luggage.
He said yesterday he had seen a lawyer and planned to sue Qantas, and understood other passengers might do the same.
The Qantas spokesman said passengers were free to pursue compensation through the courts but should be covered by travel insurance.
&quot;Qantas&apos;s liability is limited to a certain figure, that&apos;s written on the ticket,&quot; he said.
The accident was contained by the NSW Fire Brigade and the FAC&apos;s emergency response unit, which placed absorbent booms across drains.
&quot;They investigated a large fuel spill covering 500sq m,&quot; a NSW Fire Brigade spokesman said.
&quot;And Airservices Australia closed all loading operations.&quot;

			<TEXT>PAUL POTTINGER reports on efforts by international airlines to wire their jets for electronic work and play. PASSENGERS facing the mind-warping tedium of flying from Australia to almost any of the world&apos;s capitals can look forward to an array of electronic diversions to make the long hours pass quickly.
There are in-flight phone calls, faxes and modems for time-is-money business travellers, and satellite television and video games for those for whom time is simply a drag between servings of fabulous airline cuisine.
All these and more are on the way but you will have to use Asian-based carriers to enjoy them. Australia&apos;s two international airlines, Qantas and Ansett, have not yet installed these inflight features, though plans are definitely under way.
On some overseas airlines the features are already a reality, and they are a far more entertaining reality than a paperback purchased with a minimum of deliberation from a departure lounge bookshop.
Singapore Airlines (SIA) is leading the charge of regional carriers, with its Krisworld in-flight entertainment system developed by SIA and Matsushita Avionics Systems. Introduced last year, Krisworld enables passengers in all three classes to access an array of entertainment and communication services through a 20cm video screen.
Since the introduction of Krisworld to the airline&apos;s Megatop 747 fleet, 10 Nintendo games have been installed as an added feature to the already standard 22-channel multi-language movie and TV function (including news and sport), 12-channel digital audio network, and destination information function.
In first and business classes, Krisworld comes via a retractable screen; in economy the screen is fixed to the back of the facing seat.
Best of all, so far as those of us whose budgets do not stretch out of cattle class, is that all this comes at no extra cost. The air-to-ground communication facet of Krisworld is, however, another thing altogether, with telephone calls charged to your credit card, which is swiped through, EFTPOS style.
Potentially injurious to your financial health is the in-flight shopping function. Passengers pay by card and have goods home-delivered. At least it saves hanging around airport souvenir shops.
SIA&apos;s Hong Kong rival, Cathay Pacific, has also installed a Matsushita entertainment system similar to SIA&apos;s in its A-330 and A-340 Airbus fleets. Cathay is in the process of going one step better in its 747 fleet. By 1998 it intends to be the first airline to have in-seat videos in every seat, in every class.
Unlike SIA, however, in-seat mobile phones are unlikely to be part of the package. Customer surveys have revealed that a neighbour&apos;s phone chat is a disturbance that they can do without. Instead, booths will be provided for that crucial, can&apos;t-wait call.
As for devotees of Qantas and Ansett, they should not be prepared to abandon the literary delights of Wilbur Smith or Danielle Steele just yet.
As Qantas and Ansett have observed from overseas experience, installing electronic fun and games can keep an aircraft out of action for almost a month and can cost a cool $4 million per plane. They have, for the most part, adopted a watching and waiting game.
Of the two, Qantas is most reticent. A spokeswoman would say only that Qantas plans to launch a bidding process to find a preferred tenderer to provide services already a reality elsewhere.
Ansett intends to provide pop-up screens in first and business classes on 747s, and personal TV sets for business and economy passengers on 767-300s. This applies only to international services - short-duration, domestic city flights do not have the same priority.
At the moment, these electronic inflight extras are the trend internationally, an Ansett spokeswomen says.
&quot;But we need to know exactly where we&apos;re going first.&quot;
+++ USER&apos;S GUIDE TO IN-FLIGHT ELECTRONICS IF YOU have a notebook computer with a swappable CD-ROM drive, take it out of the machine and put your floppy disk back in. Just having it in your system will waste battery resources when the computer checks it every time you switch on. So load any applications you will need from the CD-ROM before you set off.
+ Avoid disk-intensive tasks such as formatting floppy disks, defragmenting your hard disk or file management operations, accessing your hard disk soaks up lots of power, If you have work that can be done with applications that are primarily memory-based and do not need to access the hard disk often (such as basic word processing) set it aside to do on the plane.
+ Take PC card modems our of your notebook. Having them in your system will drain battery power to keep them &quot;awake&quot; and ready to use. Unless you know you want to plug your modem into the in-flight phone system, tuck it in your briefcase so it won&apos;t draw more power.
+ Make sure your batteries are fully charged, that your power management software is enabled and, if you have spare batteries, that they are charged and packed in your carry-on bag. You may also want to keep your mains adaptor in your carry-on luggage, particularly if you have a stop of more than two hours between flights. Then you can plug into mains power in the transit lounge and have fully charged batteries when you resume your journey.

Ms Cameron, 55, alleged the airline breached the Trade Practices Act by accepting requests for non-smoking seats when it knew there was little prospect of securing such an allocation.
Qantas now prohibits smoking on all its flights.

			<TEXT>THE airline industry&apos;s peak lobby groups have dropped diplomatic niceties in their battle with Hong Kong authorities over proposed charges for the territory&apos;s new Chek Lap Kok airport.
This week, the Orient Airlines Association launched a stinging attack on the territory&apos;s airport authority, labelling it supercilious, absurd and deluded.
The user charges at the new $US20 billion ($26bn) airport, due to open next April, will affect all airlines including Qantas Airways and Ansett International.
Charges have not been specified but are likely to be about double the charges at the existing Kai Tak airport.
The OAA and the International Air Transport Association, both lobbying hard against the new charges, are assuming a 2.5 times increase.
Airport charges make up about 4 per cent of airlines&apos; operating costs.
Doubling charges at a major airport, for customers whose profit margins are about 3 per cent or less, has airlines worried.
Yesterday, Mr John Bailey, an IATA spokesman in Hong Kong, said some regional airlines have considered withdrawing or cutting back flights to Hong Kong, particularly cargo airlines.
He said if the new charges proceeded, other regional airports such as Macau, Shenzhen, Zhuhai and a new airport planned for Guangzhou could take flights away from Hong Kong.
But leaving Hong Kong is not an option for either Ansett or Qantas.
Hong Kong is a crucial market for Ansett&apos;s international operation, which is on a much smaller scale than that of Qantas and has targeted niche Asian markets such as Hong Kong business travellers.
Ansett&apos;s general manager international, Mr Craig Wallace, said Ansett would seek to compensate for any higher charges with cost-savings in other areas.
&quot;It obviously means a significant increase in costs for that route,&quot; he said.
&quot;In anticipation of moving to the new airport, we are working out what it means specifically for us in new costs and how to work more efficiently ... that means exploring opportunities with other carriers.&quot; Mr Wallace gave no details on possible alliances with other airlines, but such measures could include code-sharing into Hong Kong and joint arrangements for ground handling and catering.
Qantas is also concerned about the proposed charges but this week said it preferred industry bodies such as the OAA and IATA to comment publicly on the dispute.
In the OAA&apos;s latest magazine, director-general Mr Richard Stirland said Hong Kong&apos;s airport authority had displayed &quot;a decided lack of maturity&quot; in the fees dispute.
&quot;The statements made in support of these fees quite simply bear no relation to the realities of airline economics, or even to plain commonsense,&quot; he said. In a separate statement, the OAA said the authority had not operated in a transparent manner and &quot;repeated requests for information have been constantly ignored&quot;. More meetings are scheduled this year between IATA, the OAA and Hong Kong authorities, but the charges issue so far appears deadlocked.

			<TEXT>QANTAS and Ansett will inspect the bolts securing wing flaps on their Boeing 767 aircraft, following a recommendation this week by the aircraft manufacturer and an order by the United States Federal Aviation Administration.
Boeing said all airlines with 767 aircraft should carry out the extra inspections.
In the US last week a Delta Airlines 767 preparing to land in Dallas lost a 6m section of the flap from one wing. It landed safely, although the missing flap caused a slight roll.
A Boeing spokesman said it had no record of any other 767 losing a wing flap, which helps to slow the plane on ascent and descent. There are nearly 650 Boeing 767s in service worldwide.
In Australia, Qantas operates 24 of the twin-engine aircraft while Ansett operates 10 767s.
This week a Qantas spokesman said the airline acted immediately on any recommendations from aircraft manufacturers or regulators, but said full details of the Boeing recommendation had not yet been received.
The FAA has called for the inspections to be mandatory on any 767s that have flown for more than 25,000 hours or 10,000 flights.

			<TEXT>QANTAS is expected to announce the buyers of its Barrier Reef resorts next month, amid speculation that the national carrier may be forced to retain some of the five islands.
Qantas had expected the islands - Bedarra, Lizard, Dunk, Brampton and Great Keppel - to fetch between $60 million and $70 million when put to the market last May.
Property agents say there is a possibility that transaction deals may be signed for the sale of only a few of the five resorts.
This may leave the airline with little choice but to continue operating the resorts which have not been sold.
Qantas is keeping tight-lipped about details of the sale.
A Qantas spokesman said: &quot;We are still negotiating with various interested parties and are looking at a number of options including selling all the islands together as a package or selling individual resorts to buyers.&quot;
The spokesman declined to confirm whether a couple of the island resorts may be taken off the market because of a lack of response.
It is understood that a short-list of potential buyers has dwindled down to five interested parties who are still in negotiations with sole marketing agents, Richard Ellis.
A final decision on the sale of the resorts will have to be approved by the Qantas board.
The property agent said there has been strongest interest in Dunk Island since the sale offer was announced.
Interest in Lizard Island has also been keen, particularly from Hong Kong-based hotelier and developer Mr Adrian Zecha, who owns the upmarket Aman Resorts in Indonesia.
There has also been some interest in Bedarra Island resort by Singaporeans associated with hotelier, Mr Siegfred (Siggy) Beil.
Mr Beil backed by Singaporean interests, bought the Point Resort, a four-star, 28-room hotel on Mission Beach, Queensland which overlooks Bedarra Island, for about $3.5 million last December.
The deal was negotiated by JLW TransAct, Brisbane.
Mr Beil was a former business partner of Mr Zecha when they jointly developed the Beaufort-Heritage Hotel in Brisbane.
One agent said: &quot;Qantas has the choice of discounting the price further to attract a buyer or taking some of the resorts off the market. Whatever decision it makes, the airline is anxious to get the resorts off its books.&quot; Expressions of interest for the sale of the resorts closed on September 16 last year. Richard Ellis has been marketing the sale abroad, particularly in South-East Asia.
At one stage Singaporean shipping tycoon, Mr CK Ow of Hai Sun Hup was keen to buy all five resorts but only at a bargain price believed to be in the region of $49 million. Qantas was unimpressed. Mr Ow has since decided against buying any of the resorts.
Qantas acquired the resorts when it took over Australian Airlines in September, 1992.

			<TEXT>QANTAS is considering expressions of interest from parties wishing to buy its Queensland holiday island subsidiary, Australian Resorts.
The airline, which gained the six resorts on five islands in its 1992 takeover of Australian Airlines, has been after buyers for almost a year.
It considers the resorts on Bedarra, Brampton, Dunk, Great Keppel and Lizard islands to be non-core assets.
Analysts say they are worth $50-70 million.
Qantas said last May it was seeking expressions of interest in Australia and overseas.
The five resorts have a total of 500 guest rooms and $55 million turnover in the last financial year.
Heavy operating costs hit financial performance in 1994 for a $38,000 bottom line loss.
However, in 1995-96, the resorts made a profit of $2.1 million, with Bedarra and Great Keppel each contributing $700,000 after tax.
Brampton Island was the only one in the red, with a loss of $100,000.
A Qantas spokesman said several expressions of interest were being considered.
The move to sell the island resorts would end the airline&apos;s asset sales, after the recent success by ANZ Securities in placing its 19.9 per cent Air New Zealand stake.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIAN pilots are undergoing special training courses to deal with mid-air emergencies potentially triggered by design flaws in Boeing 737 aircraft.
But both Qantas and Ansett said their 737s would remain in use.
Every Boeing 737 in service had flawed rudder designs, according to a United States air safety inspectors&apos; report released on British television.
Reports of operational defects in the aircraft first surfaced late last year with the latest design problems set to further undermine the confidence of the global aviation market.
A damning US National Transportation Safety Board report concluded the 737 &quot;does not provide the same level of safety&quot; as similar types of passenger jets.
With more than 3000 of the model in operation the warning could cause havoc for world airlines.
The leaked report said rudder jamming could &quot;no longer be considered an extremely improbable or extremely remote event&quot;. Ansett said it had already started a modification program on its 22-strong fleet of Boeing 737 aircraft, operating up to 140 flights a day.
Ansett said all pilots had undertaken training courses outlining recovery manoeuvres.
Qantas said it had 38 737s in operation. &quot;We will co-operate with the aviation officials but until they actually come out with a directive we will carry on as normal,&quot; a Qantas spokesman said.

			<TEXT>AFTER a few enjoyable minutes relaxing to the dulcet tones of an Hawaiian island serenade, passengers aboard SS Independence joined hands to string a large floral lei for a ceremonial farewell to Kona on Hawaii&apos;s Big Island.
Holiday-makers traditionally take part in the throwing of the lei, hoping that such a show of friendship will bring luck and a return to the Pacific Polynesian paradise.
With a thick cloud cover building over the island&apos;s volcanic peaks, it seemed an appropriate time to leave after dodging the showers for much of the day.
But thanks to late-afternoon sun, a rainbow formed to make the occasion even more memorable.
&quot;A special hui hou from the crew,&quot; cried cruise director Keith Clark who, along with resident kumu (Hawaiian culture teacher) Haunani Kaui, helped guests to perform the ceremony.
Hui hou translates to &quot;until we meet again&quot;, and there were plenty of fans on Ohana deck to endorse those sentiments.
Captain Mark Zarynoff offered his wishes of mahola nui loa and aloha - a big thank you with love and affection.
The 6pm departure from the Big Island, renowned for its lava flows, black sandy beaches and superb whale watching, signalled the final night of a seven-night cruise which began in Honolulu one Saturday evening and circumnavigated the beautiful isles of Kauai, Maui and Hawaii.
Despite an occasional shower, the many tanned bodies were enough to indicate that all had not been lost on voyage number 872.
There was plenty to be learned on the March round trip: it snows in Hawaii, and leisure-seekers can combine surfing with a bit of snowboarding on the 3500m-plus Mauno Kea.
For newcomers to Hawaii, a cruise on Independence provides the platform to sample Polynesian culture while experiencing the many natural treasures of three contrasting islands.
Once welcomed and put through the mandatory &quot;fire and abandon ship&quot; drill, passengers can unwind and unpack in their hale (home) for a week.
After dinner, it&apos;s full-steam ahead from a picturesque Honolulu with its glittering lights along Waikiki for the waters of Kauai, the garden isle and northernmost of the eight major Hawaiian islands.
Because of the distance between main island Oahu and Kauai, the first day is spent at sea, reading or sunbathing before and after an Hawaiian craft chat, whale lecture, a bet at the &quot;races&quot;, a port talk, line dancing and ukulele lessons.
The mix of meals prepared by executive chef Stafford De Cambra and his kitchen staff are mouth-watering and well presented.
Night-time entertainment centres on a packed program including a few Broadway shows, a &quot;hang loose&quot; party, a Polynesian spectacular and a &apos;60s and &apos;70s night. After a prompt rehearsal, passengers mime to the hits of artists such as Sonny and Cher, Marvin Gaye and Tiny Tim.
Late owls retire to the Ohana Lounge for a pyjama party, karaoke or dancing into the wee hours.
Hawaii&apos;s strong stand on the prohibition of gambling prevents any losses that might have arisen around the gaming tables had there been a casino.
And because we did not leave US waters, there were no customs and immigration concerns when boarding and disembarking.
The 47-year-old vessel weighs 30,000 tonnes and can cater for up to 1025 passengers in 419 cabins (32 suites and 171 outside cabins) over nine decks.
Regular refurbishment and the fact the ship boasts spacious decks and public areas, offers a comfortable hale for sea-loving holiday-makers.

Just the ticket Getting there: Fly Qantas from Sydney to Honolulu direct Entry: Valid Australian passport. Currency: $A1 is about US76c.

			<TEXT>QANTAS Airways Ltd has made almost $100 million on the sale of its 19.9 per cent stake in Air New Zealand, ending an eight year association between the two airlines.
Qantas confirmed market speculation by announcing the $NZ425.6 million ($373.3 million) sale of its investment in Air NZ.
ANZ Securities handled the 112 million shares, which were then passed on to a range of global institutions at a price of $NZ3.80 ($3.33) a share.
Qantas chief executive James Strong said the decision to quit Air NZ was motivated by investment concerns.
&quot;This decision is purely an investment decision and does not have any operating or strategic ramifications,&quot; he said.
&quot;Through this shareholding we did not have any relationship. It was just held as an investment and that&apos;s been the position for about a year and a half.&quot;
He said the proceeds of the sale would cut net debt and reduce the gearing level by 3.3 per cent.
&quot;The capital gain from the sale will be approximately $99 million before tax,&quot; he said.
The sale is well above Air NZ&apos;s $264 million book value listed by Qantas at December 31.
It has been expected Qantas would offload its Air NZ holding when the New Zealand carrier bought TNT Ltd&apos;s 50 per cent stake in Ansett Australia last October.
Qantas did not want to remain on the Air NZ share register while that airline in turn had a half share in Qantas&apos;s domestic competitor.

Qantas had two board seats at Air NZ, but nominated independents after the Ansett acquisition.
Last month, the two airlines took steps to dissolve their code sharing Airshare alliance by saying the agreement was no longer commercially appropriate and it would end at the end of April.

			<TEXT>QANTAS Airways Ltd has made almost $100 million on the sale of its 19.9 per cent stake in Air New Zealand, ending an eight year association between the two airlines.
Qantas yesterday confirmed market speculation by announcing the $NZ425.6 million ($373.3 million) sale of its investment in Air NZ.
ANZ Securities handled the 112 million shares which were then passed on to a range of global institutions at a price of $NZ3.80 ($3.33) a share.
Qantas chief executive James Strong said the decision to quit Air NZ was motivated by investment concerns.
&quot;This decision is purely an investment decision and does not have any operating or strategic ramifications,&quot; he said.
&quot;Through this shareholding we did not have any relationship. It was just held as an investment and that&apos;s been the position for about a year and a half.&quot;
He said the proceeds of the sale would cut net debt and reduce the gearing level by 3.3 per cent.
&quot;The capital gain from the sale will be approximately $99 million before tax,&quot; he said.
The sale is well above Air NZ&apos;s $264 million book value listed by Qantas at December 31.
It has been expected Qantas would offload its Air NZ holding when the New Zealand carrier bought TNT Ltd&apos;s 50 per cent stake in Ansett Australia last October.
Qantas did not want to remain on the Air NZ share register while that airline in turn had a half share in Qantas&apos;s domestic competitor.
Since then, Qantas and Air NZ have begun unravelling their association, first struck in 1989.
&quot;We really didn&apos;t have a partnership on that route,&quot; Mr Strong said.
&quot;There was a partnership with Air NZ that went back some time which is being terminated.&quot;
Qantas had two board seats at Air NZ, but nominated independents after the Ansett acquisition.
Last month, the two airlines took steps to dissolve their code sharing Airshare alliance by saying the agreement was no longer commercially appropriate and it would end at the end of April.
Under the 1991 agreement, seating capacity and flight numbers were raised.
Either airline could carry the flight number of the other and both could sell seats on each other&apos;s flights.
Recently, Ansett and Air NZ applied to double their code share flights to fill the gap left by the Qantas departure.

			<TEXT>AIRCRAFT dumping fuel over Sydney&apos;s houses are avoiding punishment because regulations are too weak for successful prosecutions.
The Federal Government is examining the laws to crack down on &quot;fuel venting&quot; over residential areas.
But aviation officials conceded to The Daily Telegraph yesterday that fines or suspensions were unlikely to stick, even if tougher guidelines were introduced.
Both Airservices Australia and the Federal Airports Corporation said they were not responsible for the regulations.
It is understood trying to prove an individual aircraft was to blame for fuel venting would be impractical if the airline contested the matter.
This could allow aircraft involved in future breaches to avoid any disciplinary measures.
A foreign airliner dumped aviation fuel over a 10km path in Sydney&apos;s inner-west in the latest of four fuel venting incidents since 1995, Parliament has been told.
The &quot;potentially carcinogenic&quot; fuel fell over houses and schools and was spotted by residents, sparking an outcry from residents and government representatives.
The Evergreen Airlines jumbo vented fuel over the inner-west in October.
The aircraft, chartered by Qantas, was found to have leaks in five broken vent valves in the wing tanks, Labor MP Anthony Albanese said.
Transport Minister John Sharp yesterday said the Government was examining the rules for fuel venting.
&quot;The issue is being looked at. As soon as the Minister&apos;s office became aware of this several months ago it asked the (Transport) Department to investigate the matter to see what could be done to minimise any future problems,&quot; Mr Sharp&apos;s spokesman said.
Leichhardt Mayor Kris Cruden said residents had complained about fuel venting for years.
&quot;But we had previously received assurances it was in insignificant amounts. But that&apos;s been exposed now as wrong. It&apos;s appalling.&quot;
Elderly residents and local children faced real health risks from the fuel vents, particularly people with asthma and respiratory complaints, he said.
Mr Albanese called for penalties to be imposed on airlines.
&quot;You would expect some sort of penalty, a financial impost, the banning of the particular aircraft (or) some action which says to these airlines that the Government actually thinks that this is not on.&quot;

			<TEXT>QANTAS Airways has finally cut all ties with Air New Zealand, yesterday accepting an offer for its 19.4 per cent stake in the Trans-Tasman rival that will deliver a pre-tax profit of $99 million.
The Qantas board formally accepted the offer made earlier this week by stockbroker ANZ Securities for the 112 million B-class shares, which are limited to foreign investors, at $NZ3.80 a share or $NZ425.6 million ($387 million).
Air NZ B-class shares jumped NZ5c after the sale announcement to $NZ3.95. Domestic A-class shares closed NZ1c lower at $NZ2.69.
Qantas shares rose slightly after the announcement but closed 2c lower at $2.45.
ANZ Securities said the Air NZ shares had already been placed with a variety of institutions around the world. The buyers are believed to be limited to investment institutions and do not include international airlines. Qantas managing director Mr James Strong stressed that the approach by ANZ Securities had been unsolicited and said Qantas had treated the sale as an &quot;investment decision&quot;. Air NZ has a variety of alliance partners, including United Airlines, which operates code-share flights. However, the US airline had said previously it would not be interested in an equity stake in its alliance partner.
But other airlines have at least considered the Air NZ holding, including Singapore Airlines, which earlier tried to buy a stake in Qantas and Ansett.
Mr Strong said the total sale proceeds of nearly $380 million would be used to reduce Qantas&apos; gearing.
At June 30 last year, Qantas&apos; net debt stood at $1.6 billion.
After the Air NZ sale, only Qantas&apos; island resorts remain as a large non-core asset likely to be sold. Mr Strong said yesterday the five islands - Great Keppel, Brampton, Lizard, Bedarra and Dunk - were still &quot;under review&quot;. Although Qantas had not actively marketed the Air NZ stake, and had denied it was for sale, the airline has been waiting to offload the shares for some months.
Air NZ, once a potential Trans-Tasman partner for Qantas, is now a fierce competitor and shareholder in Qantas rival Ansett Australia. The holding did not give Qantas any real influence at Air NZ and had become a sore point for both airlines, particularly after two Qantas directors, including Mr Strong, left the Air NZ board last year.
Qantas also had the potential to block Air NZ&apos;s investment in Ansett when the $350 million purchase went before shareholders last year. It did not, but its presence has made Air NZ and Ansett nervous.
Brierley Investments is Air NZ&apos;s biggest shareholder with 42.5 per cent.
Air NZ is likely to report a disappointing 1996-97 result after its interim profit fell 43 per cent to $NZ76.7 million. It has been hit hard by rising jet fuel prices and a strong New Zealand dollar. Returns from the Ansett group have also been disappointing.
But managing director Mr Jim McCrea said earlier this month he believed the airline would recover in 1997-98 as fuel prices and the NZ currency stabilised.
*
Qantas&apos; general manager, commercial, Mr Geoff Dixon, said yesterday the installation of in-flight entertainment systems was inevitable for top airlines and Qantas was likely to decide on IFE personal systems within three months.
Qantas has been testing various personal IFE systems, which offer videos, games, shopping and gambling through individual monitors for each airline seat.
But it has so far been coy on its commitment to IFE systems, with cost and reliability a consideration for all airlines.
&quot;We have not made the final decision on whether we will proceed with interactive systems or not yet,&quot; Mr Dixon said.
&quot;We have done a lot of work in the past 18 months in testing up the systems.
&quot;But it would be very, very hard for top airlines with quality products to sit out of this in the long term. I don&apos;t think it is necessary to go in now because some of the systems don&apos;t work that well yet.&quot;

			<TEXT>COMPETITION brought about by discounted air fares has helped New Zealand maintain its top rating as Australian travellers&apos; number one overseas destination.
More than 415,000 travellers made the trip across the Tasman last year, an increase of 44,000 on the previous year.
A major reason for the increase was the air fare battle between the now-defunct Kiwi Air and Freedom Air, Air New Zealand and Qantas.
America remained the second most popular destination with 331,000 visitors last year.

			<TEXT>AIRLINES are providing entire flight crews of working mothers to allow them to balance work and family life.
Flight attendants today revealed that flexible rostering of hours has enabled many of them to stay in the workforce.
Many drop their children at school before catching flights to Melbourne or Brisbane that are timetabled to arrive back in Sydney in time for them to care for their children at night.
Nicole Ryan, mother of two girls and with another baby expected in June, has worked for Qantas for more than eight years and said today that the flexibility of the rostering system &quot;works really well for mothers&quot;. &quot;I often fly with crews where everyone is a mother,&quot; she said.
The flexibility will allow Nicole to put the new baby into daycare and return to work next March.
Flight attendant Trudy Ager, mother of Miles, 21/2 and Austin, seven months, said: &quot;The system means I can work part-time, one to two days a week. I work early in the morning so I can be home for dinner, bath time and story time.&quot;

			<TEXT>ADVERTISERS targeting the lucrative gay market are not leaping to show their support on commercial television.
Many supporters of the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras and other gay events will not be advertising during the telecast of the parade on Channel Ten tonight.
Most, including major sponsors like Telstra, Qantas and Tooheys, say that short notice about the telecast or advertising budget constraints were the reason why they were not taking air time. Others say they were not even aware that it was being telecast.
But Ten says there has been no shortage of advertisers keen to fill spots during the 90-minute telecast from 9.30.
A Ten spokesperson said that ad time was booked out but would not reveal who the companies advertising were.

			<TEXT>QANTAS and Aussie Airlines will continue negotiations this week over access to domestic airport terminals, with the Federal Airports Corp expected to agree to a request from both companies to extend the talks.
Aussie Airlines, headed by Mr Bryan Grey, wants access to terminal space at five domestic airports leased to Qantas by the FAC.
After a series of court battles, Qantas and Aussie began negotiations in December, with a deadline of February 28 set by the FAC for sub-leases to be signed.
On Friday, however, an FAC spokesperson said the talks were continuing beyond the original deadline, with some progress being made.
The talks follow a Federal Court hearing in Melbourne in December when Qantas sought an injunction against breach of lease notices served by the FAC.
The notices demanded Qantas enter bona fide negotiations with Aussie.
The FAC said if Qantas did not enter negotiations as required by its lease the airline could be locked out of the five terminals.
The injunctions were suspended after Qantas agreed to negotiations, but the FAC and Qantas have refused to rule out further legal action.
After the release of Qantas&apos; first-half results earlier this month, managing director Mr James Strong said the airline had &quot;various legal options&quot; if the talks failed.

			<TEXT>QANTAS has taken another step to unwind its once-close relationship with Air New Zealand, with the two airlines yesterday announcing the end of their Airshare alliance agreement from May.
The long-expected termination of Airshare reinforces how Qantas and Air NZ have become entrenched in rival world airline alliance camps.
The Airshare arrangement was forged in 1991, as a means of increasing flights between Australia and NZ while freeing up aircraft for other routes.
But the agreement, and broader relationship, has been doomed since Air NZ bought a 50 per cent stake in Ansett Holdings last year.
Qantas still holds a 19.9 per cent shareholding in Air NZ, which Qantas chairman Mr Gary Pemberton last week said was not for sale. However, Qantas is believed to be ready to offload the stake, with Qantas representatives already off the Air NZ board.
Yesterday Qantas general manager, commercial, Mr Geoff Dixon said the Airshare agreement was &quot;no longer commercially appropriate&quot;. Both Air NZ and Qantas will introduce some new flights across the Tasman to compensate for the end of the agreement, with Qantas offering about 38,000 return seats and Air NZ offering about 34,000.
Both Ansett and Air NZ are being drawn into a world alliance that will include United Airlines of the US and Lufthansa of Germany.
Qantas is aligned with 25 per cent shareholder British Airways and American Airlines, a grouping that will become even closer if a proposed mega-alliance between BA and American is approved by regulatory authorities.
In December, Ansett and Air NZ announced codesharing on Australian domestic flights and routes between Sydney, Brisbane and Auckland, which are now likely to be extended to all main trans-Tasman routes.
Last week Air NZ said the Ansett alliance had exceeded expectations in its first months, delivering more bookings and revenue than anticipated.
However Ansett made little contribution to Air NZ&apos;s first half result.

			<TEXT>AVIATION is a tough and competitive business. Airlines spend millions on fleet upgrades, route schedules and advertising.
But with price and safety rarely a distinguishing factor between Ansett and Qantas, the crucial decision on which airline to fly often boils down to snacks and videos.
For Melba the decision between Ansett or Qantas has been a toss-up - the hot soup and focaccia on the former, or the Cadbury&apos;s chocolate handouts on the latter?
Ansett hopes to have an extra attraction later this year when it screens the winners of its Pegasus Awards, a short film competition with prizes attractive to any struggling film-maker.
For a short film of five minutes or less, winners could jet to the Tokyo film festival on a $15,000 holiday or take home $10,000 worth of film stock and post-production studio time.
But read the conditions carefully before rushing out with your camcorder. The judges will not accept entries with any sex, nudity, excessive violence, drug references or obscene language.
Air disasters are also a no-no, which doesn&apos;t leave much subject matter for any budding Quentin Tarantinos.

			<TEXT>QANTAS has re-based its aircrew to the four-star Parkroyal Plaza Hotel in Sydney&apos;s Kings Cross in a deal that is worth more than $1 million a year.
About 700 cabin crew a month will now be based at Parkroyal Plaza. They will occupy an average of 5000 rooms each year.
Mr Peter Savoff, general manager of the hotel, said: &quot;It was a hotly contested contract with a number of five-star CBD hotels competing for the business.
&quot;However, we were ready to commit to a four-year deal with moderate room rate increases each year which won the confidence of Qantas.&quot;
The crew were previously based at the Sheraton Airport Hotel.
It is understood that Qantas negotiated an attractive deal with a 30 per cent discount in room rates. Crew are also entitled to a discount on laundry, dry-cleaning, food and beverages.
The 278-room hotel has an average occupancy of about 90 per cent and an average room rate of $120 a night.
To sweeten the deal, the hotel has also bought four mountain bicycles for the exclusive use of crew members who are keen to maintain a keep-fit regime.
A Qantas official said that the change of hotel is the best option for its crew.
&quot;The market is dictated by supply and demand. In the past we have also used the Inter-Continental and the Nikko Hotel in Darling Harbour,&quot; said the official.

			<TEXT>AIRLINES have to wring blood out of a stone to deliver profit growth in the present market but Qantas Airways yesterday genuinely surprised analysts with higher earnings despite heavy jet fuel costs and serious problems in one of its most important markets.
Qantas&apos; net profit rose 2.1 per cent to $151.4 million, but most forecasts had predicted no growth whatsoever and many were calling a sharp plunge. When compared to Air New Zealand&apos;s results released on Wednesday, Qantas, initially, looks even better.
AirNZ&apos;s profit plunged 43 per cent to $NZ76.7 million ($69.7 million), after the airline was hit by a combination of high jet fuel prices, a strong local currency, flat passenger growth and disappointing returns from its new investment in the Ansett group.
Qantas also suffered from higher jet fuel prices, which wiped $50 million off its interim net profit. However, the airline has managed to avoid the dive suffered by AirNZ, largely as a result of its huge cost-savings program which delivered $237 million in the half year.
But AirNZ should not lose its reputation as one of the world&apos;s most profitable airlines, measured on yield rather than dollar terms, just yet. When AirNZ&apos;s net profit is measured as a yield on total revenue of $NZ1.46 billion, the return of 5.4 per cent makes the airline business look almost tempting.
By contrast, Qantas&apos; corresponding figure of 3.7 per cent, on revenue of $4 billion, would not convince many to rush out and start an airline.
Still, Qantas has delivered higher profits at a time when other world airlines have gone into the red. This is despite Qantas making almost no money from Japan in the December half, a market which once provided almost all of its international earnings and where AirNZ still made a healthy, albeit lower, profit.
Managing director Mr James Strong attributed the fall to a structural change in the Japanese tourism industry, in which wholesalers are losing their dominance, combined with the sluggish economy and stronger yen.
There is at least one good omen for a fullyear result to match last year&apos;s net profit of $246 million. Jet fuel prices rose nearly 40 per cent during the first half but have now dropped back to about $US28 a barrel, compared with a peak of $US35 a barrel.
But Australasian airlines&apos; second half performance is almost always softer than the first and a big improvement on last year is unlikely. [][][][]
BEHIND the fracas between Transport Minister Mr Sharp and the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority are two quite separate issues that have been rolled into one muddy mess. The minister has wide industry support for appointing his own board to CASA. However, the separate question of who he might wish to appoint to the board, and their suitability for the role, has caused some concern across aviation industry groups and has been seized by the incumbent board as reason to resist.
Mr Sharp is arguing that he has the right to make his own appointments to a board that will help the authority carry out government policy. There is an unwritten, but generally accepted, rule that political appointees on statutory boards should gracefully make way for new faces upon a change of government.
Mr Sharp is aggrieved that CASA chairman Justice William Fisher is not obeying the unwritten rules. Justice Fisher has refused to budge, not so much because of the principle of independence, although that plays a part, as who Mr Sharp might appoint in his place.
The minister has never publicly discussed candidates for the CASA board but it is widely accepted that former Civil Aviation Authority chairman Mr Dick Smith is a strong contender. Mr Smith has repeatedly expressed his wish to reform the regulator and resigned as president of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association last year in order to shore up his chances for a CASA appointment.
Justice Fisher has professional and personal objections to Mr Smith returning to CASA. His concerns are shared by some sections of the aviation industry, although other lobby groups passionately support the appointment.
Between the board and the Government sits the regulator itself, where the battle is causing a drain on resources and morale.

			<TEXT>QANTAS Airways Ltd yesterday defied market expectations to deliver a 2.1 per cent increase in interim net profit, despite bottom-line losses of more than $50 million due to higher fuel costs and a collapse in earnings from the once lucrative market of Japan.
The $151.4 million net profit for the six months to December 31 exceeded the most optimistic forecasts and augurs well for a full-year profit at least equal to last year&apos;s $246 million.
The interim dividend of 6c, however, will be unfranked, compared with a partly franked 6c dividend in the previous first half.
Qantas chairman Mr Gary Pemberton remained cautious on the full-year outlook and said that much of the interim profit was due to an aggressive cost-cutting program which delivered $237 million in savings.
The domestic market has also softened, with profits down more than 5 per cent to $88.2 million despite a 6.6 per cent rise in revenue to $2.02 billion and a 5.5 per cent increase in revenue passenger kilometres.
Qantas shares rose as much as 10c after the announcement before closing 4c higher at $2.46.
Mr Pemberton said the higher profit was almost entirely due to cost-cutting, with only a modest increase in revenue of 2.5 per cent to $4 billion.
Higher jet fuel prices cost the airline almost $50 million in net profit and the Japanese market made &quot;very little contribution at all&quot;, after a fall of almost 25 per cent in revenue from Japan to $315 million.
The cost savings included $90 million from &quot;labour-related initiatives&quot;, which the airline said included productivity gains and tighter management of rosters and overtime.
In November, an internal memo to staff from managing director Mr James Strong said the airline&apos;s cost-cutting program would inevitably mean some redundancies. However, Mr Pemberton yesterday said total staff numbers had actually increased.
Mr Strong denied a food poisoning incident on a Japan flight last year, when passengers on flights to Taiwan and Japan were hospitalised, had a material effect on revenues from Japan.
Instead, he said the market had been affected by a combination of factors including the stronger yen, a weak economy, a shift in Japan&apos;s wholesale tourism sales network and more competition from airlines using the new Kansai airport, including Ansett International.
Most other international sectors were steady, except trans-Tasman routes which were dented by price competition from the now defunct Kiwi International and Air New Zealand subsidiary Freedom Air International.
Mr Strong said negotiations with Aussie Airlines and Mr Bryan Grey over access to Qantas domestic airport terminals were still under way.
The Federal Airports Corp, which leases the domestic terminal space to Qantas, has set a deadline of next Friday for sub-leases to be in place.
However, Mr Strong said Qantas had not abandoned the option of legal action against Aussie Airlines over the issue of domestic terminal access.
Qantas holds a 19.9 per cent stake in Air New Zealand, which Mr Pemberton said yesterday the airline had no plans to sell.
Qantas has been in discussions with both Boeing Co and Airbus Industrie about the development of aircraft to carry 600 or more passengers, but Mr Strong said the issue was not a high priority.
Boeing has abandoned plans to develop a stretched version of its 747 series but Airbus continues to work on the double-decker A3-XX, for which it is seeking launch customers.
&quot;It is not a huge issue for us, at what rate they develop that type of aircraft,&quot; Mr Strong said. [] [] [] TABLE AVAILABLE - QANTAS AIRWAYS LTD AT A GLANCE.

			<TEXT>A 43 per cent slump in Air New Zealand&apos;s first-half profit, announced yesterday, has highlighted the impact of rising jet-fuel prices on world airlines.
The carrier&apos;s interim profit fell to $NZ76.7 million ($69.7 million) from $NZ135 million in the previous year.
The six-month result to December 30 includes a flat performance from Air New Zealand&apos;s investments in Ansett Australia and Ansett International, the former showing a modest profit but the international airline reporting higher-than-expected losses.
Higher jet fuel prices have affected all airlines, including Qantas Airways which will report its first-half result today.
Analysts have predicted Qantas will struggle to exceed last year&apos;s interim net profit of $148.1 million, with forecasts of between $115 million and $145 million.
But Qantas is unlikely to suffer as dramatic a profit fall as Air New Zealand.
As a 19.9 per cent shareholder in its trans-Tasman rival, Qantas&apos; result will partly be affected by lower dividends.
Both airlines have been hit by steep increases in jet-fuel prices, which rose up to 40 per cent during the six months.
However, Air New Zealand has also contended with a strong New Zealand dollar, up nearly 9 per cent against the Japanese yen and 4 per cent on the trade weighted index.
The stronger currency has made New Zealand a less attractive tourist destination and accounted for a $NZ50 million reduction in Air New Zealand&apos;s revenue for the six months.
Total revenue for Air New Zealand fell 2.5 per cent on the previous year to $NZ1.46 billion.
Air New Zealand&apos;s investment in the Ansett group has not yet paid hefty dividends, although the airline said benefits from code-sharing and other alliance agreements had been higher than expected.
But Air New Zealand appears to have benefited from lucky timing, taking its 50 per cent Ansett Australia equity stake just as Ansett returned to profit after heavy losses in the 1996-97 first quarter.
Air New Zealand said Ansett had contributed $NZ16.7 million in profit for the three months to December 31, suggesting the Australian airline recorded profits of around $30 million for the quarter.
For the previous quarter, Ansett recorded unquantified losses, a period Air New Zealand missed while it waited for Australian government approval for its $350 million investment in Ansett.
Air New Zealand finally bought 50 per cent of the restructured Ansett Australia from TNT Ltd on September 30 last year, after a drawn-out sale.
Yesterday&apos;s Air New Zealand result does not augur well for its full-year profit, which the airline said is likely to fall below $NZ150 million, compared with $NZ225.2 million for 1995-96.
Australasian airlines traditionally record stronger results in the first half of the financial year, with a full six months of high-yield business travel uninterrupted by summer holidays.

			<TEXT>THE New Zealand Minister for Transport, Mrs Jenny Shipley, will consider making a direct appeal to the Australian public urging more competition for Qantas and Ansett on international air routes if she fails to win Australian government support for such proposals.
In a briefing yesterday on New Zealand&apos;s efforts to open up more beyond rights for foreign carriers through Australia, Mrs Shipley praised her Australian counterpart, Mr John Sharp, for being willing to &quot;confront&quot; the &quot;comfortable duopoly&quot; of Qantas and Ansett Australia on the issue.
She described as &quot;frustrating&quot; the Australian Cabinet&apos;s understanding of the economic benefits of such a move.
Asked whether she might appeal directly to Australians on the issue, Mrs Shipley said: &quot;Come and see me in six months if we are still not any further forward as to whether we then try to discuss with consumers that, in fact, lower prices, better access and so on would be the benefits they would see if beyond rights were extended.&quot;
Although Australian ministers had been receptive to New Zealand&apos;s arguments during meetings last week, she was &quot;surprised by the extent to which we are still going to have to build economic arguments to create an environment in which they are likely to take a Cabinet decision which will assist us&quot;. While she did not name Qantas and Ansett, she found their arguments had been advanced more vigorously at a political level in Australia than was usual in New Zealand.
&quot;There is no doubt in Australia there is some tension between airlines&apos; interests and Australia&apos;s interests,&quot; she said.
&quot;The vast majority of our presentation and arguments were ... that it was actually in the economies&apos;, the public interest to try to expand both access and capacity into our respective countries rather than worrying about the fate of any particular airline.&quot; The Australian airlines argued that existing beyond rights - the right to pick up passengers in Australia during flights between New Zealand and third countries - should be used up before new ones were granted.
However, she argued that national interests needed to take a more medium-term view, and warned that Australasian airlines&apos; success could depend on building an early presence in fast-growing Asian markets.
&quot;We tried to prevail upon the Australians that, given the speed with which some airlines are moving, it is quite inappropriate that we do anything that may allow the Australasian airlines to languish in the view that they don&apos;t have to be absolutely competitive,&quot; Mrs Shipley said.
Mr Sharp has agreed to present Australian airlines with New Zealand analysis showing that opening up new beyond rights through Australia had increased the total aviation market.
The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, said in Wellington on Monday that the issue remained &quot;difficult&quot; for Australia.
Mrs Shipley is due to meet Mr Sharp again in May, before the Australian Transport Council meeting that month in Cairns.

			<TEXT>THE interim profit season moves into full swing this week with the publication of several top-100 listed stocks, including retail giant, Woolworths, Burns Philp, Qantas and Leighton Holdings.
Other big companies to report include Normandy Mining, Transurban, RGC Ltd and Australian National Industries.
The results are expected to be a mixed bag depending on the industry involved but will, nonetheless, provide a clearer picture about the emerging two-tier economy.
Profit results that have emerged during the past few weeks have confirmed that manufacturing and retailing, in general, have not benefited from prolonged economic growth that has instead favoured sectors such as telecommunications, finance and mining.
However, Woolworths is expected to buck the poor-profit trend among retailers by announcing an interim net profit of between $144 million and $150 million when it reports today.
Analysts expect a strong result, putting the group on track for a full year net up by as much as 11 per cent to $290 million. Woolworths in January reported an 8.6 per cent rise in sales for the half-year to $8.22 billion, helped along by a revival of its Big W discount chain.
Heavy engineering group ANI tomorrow is expected to overcome troubles with its Holter environmental unit to post an interim net of as much as $16 million compared with $5.2 million in the previous corresponding period.
At the other end of the financial spectrum, Burns Philp on Thursday is expected to report a further nosedive in profitability with a profit downgraded by as much as 20 per cent.
The troubled 114-year-old global spice and yeast giant has already told the stock exchange that its interim profit this year is expected to vary by no more than 15 per cent on last year&apos;s $52.5 million interim net.
Burns Philp reported its first full-year loss last September - of $61.8 million on the back of a $137 million abnormal charge relating to a change in the carrying value of its assets.
Meanwhile, a jump in jet fuel costs by as much as 30 per cent is expected to pin back Qantas&apos; interim half to about $116 million when it reports on Thursday.
Also reporting on Thursday is Leighton Holdings Ltd, which is expected to buck the trend among construction companies by reporting a rise in net profit of between $30 million to $35 million, boosted by a strong order book.
Chief executive Mr Wal King told shareholders last year at the annual meeting that &quot;another strong and profitable year&quot; was expected.
Leighton has been one of the best performers of the past 10 years, delivering an annual average return to shareholders of 32 per cent.

			<TEXT>WESTPAC, Ansett Australia and Visa International have joined forces to offer a frequent flyer card, the Global Rewards Westpac Visa, giving consumers more choice in what has become an extremely popular personal finance sector.
Visa has already demonstrated the popularity of this type of product, with last year&apos;s successful launch of the Qantas Telstra Visa card, issued by ANZ.
American Express has signed up 300,000 card holders for its Membership Rewards program, in which Qantas is a partner.
And the Fly Buys people (National Australia Bank, Ansett, Qantas, Air New Zealand, Coles Myer and Shell) claim to have more than 2 million households involved in their program.
There is no doubt that frequent flyer programs are enormously popular. Every banker, travel operator, card company and market researcher will tell you that.
What they will not tell you is which card to choose. Each program has its own characteristics - methods of calculating points, range of program partners, range of rewards on offer, period for which points are valid, and vesting requirements (the minimum number of points that must be accumulated in a year before those points can be &quot;redeemed&quot;).
Part of the problem is that the participants tend to be promiscuous. There are not many programs in which Qantas is not involved. Visa is heavily involved across the sector. As a result, the participants are reluctant to single out any program for particular criticism or praise. They tell you that no program is necessarily better than another; it is a matter for the consumer to make a selection based on their spending behaviour and their preferred rewards.
# The Global Rewards Westpac Visa. The Ansett, Westpac and Visa alliance has added some gloss to its offering by incorporating the Sydney 2000 Olympic logo on its card. Because all three are official sponsors, they have the blessing of SOCOG to use the image of the millennium athlete in their branding.
The card&apos;s big selling point is its relative simplicity. Consumers earn one point for every dollar spent on the card. (It is a credit card, by the way; it is often difficult to find reference to the word credit in the promotional literature that accompanies these products.) It does not matter where that dollar is spent; Westpac will give the card holder a point for a dollar.
In addition, Ansett and its Global Rewards partners will give card holders additional points for purchasing their services through the card.
So, someone travelling from Brisbane to Sydney on Ansett and paying for it with the card will earn 594 points from Westpac (equivalent to the cost of a full economy return ticket) and 1494 points from Ansett (calculated on the basis of one point a kilometre travelled).
If that traveller hires a car from Avis for four days at a cost of $356, he or she will receive 356 points from Westpac and 2848 points from Avis.
Ansett&apos;s Global Rewards program partners include Avis, several hotel groups and Telstra. Members have redemption choices from four categories: flights and flight upgrades, car rental and car upgrades, accommodation and travel. The card comes with a $40 annual fee ($85 for gold), up to 55 days free credit and an interest rate of 16.4 per cent on outstanding balances. Ansett has a one-off joining fee of $50 for membership to Global Rewards and a 9000 point vesting target for flight rewards.
# American Express Membership Rewards. As with the card detailed above, American Express promotes the simplicity of its frequent flyer product - one point for one dollar, wherever the money is spent. The Amex product is a charge card, which means there is no interest rate (but bills must be paid within 30 days). Members must pay a $60 annual fee ($90 for gold) and a one-off $50 fee to join the Qantas frequent flyer program. The vesting target is 5000 points but there is no expiry date for points.
One limitation of the Amex program is that Qantas is the only organisation issuing bonus points. Card members who fly with Qantas can earn double points but there are no arrangements with car rental companies or hotel groups.
Amex card holders have the option of a program that offers non-flight rewards. There is no additional membership fee and no participation with Qantas. Points go towards eligibility for rewards offered in nine categories: car services, dining, entertainment, financial services, shopping vouchers, subscriptions, travel and one-offs such as parties on yachts.
# Qantas Telstra Visa Card. This card is driven by a system of bonus points offered by several travel companies, general service providers and retailers.
Card holders get two points for every dollar they spend on the card but these are reward points, not frequent flyer points. It takes four reward points to equal one Qantas frequent flyer point.
However, there are bonus points available from program partners that add as many as 20 bonus points a dollar spent.
The aim of this card is to get people to change their consumer habits and direct all their spending through the card towards selected merchants and service providers.
Those program partners include Qantas, Telstra, several hotel groups, automotive products suppliers, building products companies, business services, Hertz and Thrifty, fashion stores, computer suppliers, financial services companies and lots of retailers.
The annual fee is $40 ($75 for gold) and card holders must pay an $50 fee to join the Qantas frequent flyer program. The interest rate on outstanding balances is 16.7 per cent and there are 44 interest-free days.
# Fly Buys. Like the Qantas Telstra Visa Card, this one is based on points handed out at nominated outlets. It operates through a stand-alone card or a credit card issued by National Australia Bank.
Participants include Shell, Coles Supermarkets, Myer, Grace Bros, Katies, Target, K mart, Bi-Lo, Liquorland, Budget, Traveland, Red Rooster and Telstra. The program is promoted as the frequent flyer program for people who don&apos;t fly. Points are valid for three years and can be exchanged for travel with Qantas, Ansett and Air New Zealand, as well as several travel packages.
Critics of these programs, where selected retailers and service providers offer bonus points, argue that the consumer may not be any better off. The merchant can price the cost of the reward into the item purchased and consumers miss out on the opportunity to buy more cheaply elsewhere.
Also, some of the offers fall short of their claims. For instance, franchise or agency groups such as Shell do not offer points at all their outlets.

That&apos;s exactly what travellers heading off on Qantas domestic flights will be able to do, thanks to a new exhibit at Sydney&apos;s Kingsford Smith Airport.
The Australian Technology Expo, designed by Original Ventures (Pacific) and sponsored by The Australian, hopes to take advantage of the idle hours travellers spend in airports by allowing them to experience the latest technology.
Exhibitors pay between $7500 and $30,000 to have their products showcased to a potential audience of thousands of people a day, many of them business travellers.
The interactive display&apos;s official launch tomorrow marks the start of a three-month stint in Sydney before it heads out on a national tour, taking in Qantas domestic terminals at Adelaide, Melbourne, Canberra and Brisbane.
The 60 square metre Sydney display showcases technology from manufacturers such as Epson, Intel, Ericsson, Sharp and Acer, as well as innovations in car security, the Internet, computer projection equipment and software. Trained staff demonstrate the technology and how the numerous exhibits can interact with one another.
The experience is sweetened by a sweepstakes, offering more than $150,000 in prizes.
The Australian Technology Expo had its genesis in similar shows run by Intel and Newsweek in the United States.
Intel teamed with computer manufacturers to run displays and a sweepstakes in several US airports, and Intel representatives were able to use the exercise to build an impressive database of potential clients.
&quot;They found that a minimum 10 per cent who entered the sweepstakes in the following six months were involved with the purchase of one or more laptop computers,&quot; marketing director of Original Ventures, Mr Colin McLennan, said.
&quot;Nobody&apos;s suggesting that they went and bought a laptop because they went to that exhibit but it meant that the exhibit attracted the
people who were in the market,&quot; he explained.
Original Ventures officials took the concept one step further by suggesting exhibitors use the opportunity to demonstrate how technologies interact.
&quot;Here, we can have an executive come in and you can say, `Would you like to send a fax on this mobile phone to that Acer computer over there and watch it come out of an Epson printer?&apos; &quot; Mr McLennan said.
Many of the exhibits also are self-demonstrating.
Mr McLennan said the exhibit opened unofficially last week and word is already spreading.
The show, which is located after security at the Qantas terminal, is manned from 6am to 8pm Monday to Friday, and 8am to 8pm Saturday and Sunday.

			<TEXT>THE share price of Qantas Airways Ltd has been like its aircraft up, levelled out, down, level again and then, since January 6, 1997, in a near vertical take-off.
There are, however, some interesting features in the price chart, which can be used to give some indications as to its next move.
The most recent action, since September 1996, has been the formation of an inverted head and shoulders pattern, which gives rise to a first target in the vicinity of $2.60, followed by $2.74.
The previous resistance at $2.20 was blown away in the latest takeoff, which is now forming a down-sloping flag on a large flagpole, from $2.10 to $2.42, and a break above the peak produces a target of $3.05-$3.10.
The area between $2.40 and $2.47 has been achieved on three separate occasions and is thus providing considerable resistance.
In basic bar charting terms, the downtrend channel from $2.47 in March 1996, to the low of $1.79 in November, was broken when the price rose through $2 in December.
Then, after a couple of weeks&apos; consolidation between $2.15 and $2.05, the price flew up to $2.42 in six days. The ensuing pattern is now suggesting some further consolidation is likely, even down to the area of support around $2.20.
There were some high-volume days as the price moved into the left shoulder and much higher volume as the price moved through the right shoulder, which in classical Edwards &amp; Magee terms signifies a major reversal of trend.
The volume of trading is still above average in this reactionary phase. The MACD histogram was showing divergence over the low points from July, September and November.
This indicator gave a buy signal in early December when it crossed above the zero line and, at the same time, the price was closing above a 34-day moving average, at the completion of the right shoulder.
The MACD (moving average convergence/divergence) is constructed using three exponential moving averages of short, medium and longer duration.
Briefly, when the fast MACD line crosses above the slower signal line, it indicates that the buyers are in control and one should only trade in the direction of the trend. The MACD histogram gives a deeper insight into the market control than does the original line MACD.
When the fast line is above the slow line, the MACD histogram is plotted above a zero line, while when the fast line is below the slow line the histogram is negative - below the zero line. The picture generated by this graph can be of benefit to the trader as well as the investor.

			<TEXT>AUSTRALIANS are taking shorter, more frequent holidays and timing them to coincide with special theatrical and sporting events, according to research released yesterday.
The general manager of Qantas Holidays, Mr Ken Rosebery, said packaged holiday sales appeared to be defying a more general downturn in the domestic holiday market with States hosting major events likely to be the big winners in the future.
Speaking at the launch of Qantas&apos;s new range of Australian holiday packages, Mr Rosebery said much of the increase in short-stay interstate holidays was attributable to bookings made in conjunction with special events.
&quot;Holiday traffic into Sydney, for example, experienced an average increase of 38 per cent for the first eight months of 1996 due to considerable interest in our Miss Saigon and Phantom of the Opera packages,&quot; he said.
While Mr Rosebery declined to release actual figures for commercial reasons, he said Qantas Australian Holidays, a subsidiary company of Qantas, had achieved &quot;a healthy increase&quot; in passenger numbers last year.
This was despite widespread industry concern about the domestic market which led to the formation last year of a committee by Tourism Council Australia to investigate the downturn.
Much of the concern has centred on Queensland, but Mr Rosebery said the Gold Coast, Cairns and the Sunshine Coast had been among Qantas&apos;s best performing destinations for 1996.
He said Cairns had recorded 10 per cent growth, due largely to increasing interest in the nearby resort towns of Port Douglas and Palm Cove, while the Sunshine Coast had grown by 11 per cent.
Qantas was especially pleased by a 5 per cent increase in passenger numbers to the Gold Coast given the very large and mature nature of the market, he said.
The Northern Territory had the largest growth of 13 per cent.

			<TEXT>ANSETT&apos;S bid for a larger slice of the lucrative Japanese market was rejected yesterday when the International Air Services Commission announced a five-year renewal of Qantas&apos; existing capacity rights.
IASC chairman Mr Jim Bain said it was the first time provisions governing existing rights had been tested since the introduction of competition among Australian carriers on international routes.
He said the provisions created a rebuttable presumption in favour of the incumbent capacity holder.
&quot;Ansett had applied for capacity but, under the Act, the commission could only grant capacity to Ansett if the commission first concluded that Qantas had failed to service the route effectively,&quot; Mr Bain said.
&quot;The commission did not believe it had grounds to conclude that Qantas had not serviced the route effectively.&quot;
The five-year renewal applies from June 30 this year, when Qantas&apos; existing rights were due to expire.
